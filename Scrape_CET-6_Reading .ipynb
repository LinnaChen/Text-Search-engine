       "'NO.1:\\nEnglish:\\nA consistent approach is pivotal to successfully teaching a son or daughter right from wrong when punishing them. It prevents small misdeeds and poor conduct from tunung into greater misdeeds. You have to remain unwavering and mean it when you ask them, \"Switch off your computer now”or “no dessert after dinner because you didn\\'t touch your dinnet”.A consistent approach shows your son or daughter there are express effects for misdeeds and improper or unsatisfactory deeds or manners.Displaying a lack of consistency when purushing makes you directly accountable for your children\\'s misdeeds and wiU not teach them how to be liable for their exploitsIt\\'s also necessary that each partner is consistent with the discipline.If one parent is firm and the other is too forgiving, the son or daugh ter will key into that and attempt to manipulate the position to his or her dvantage. Parents must be in agreement on disciplinary code beforehand and make a commitment to each other to be consistent in carrying out and following through with the consequences. This can be especially dimcult if the child\\'s parents are divorced or separated. (1) Though you are not living together, it\\'s crucial that both parents have a united ground. (2) Openly and honestly agree these parameters with your former spouse and your son or daughter in advance, so that if any disciplinary action is called for, the effect of such misdeeds are fully realizedin adv:ince.Any disagreements between parents should be debated when the childis not present.Being consistent refers to being resolute, even when doing so is really demanding or gruelling. (3) It can someti mes be diffcults to arrive home after a lon8 day at work only to find a challenging evening of parenting in store for you.Your son or daughter will consistently probe the parameters and push the envelope\\' with you to see if there\\'s any play in those consequences. By being resolute you are establishing there is not and that you demand them to do nothing less than assume the burden for their deeds.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n当你因自己的儿子或女儿做了错事而惩罚他们时，前后一致的教育途径是至关重要的，它能预防小错变大。但是你一定要保持坚定，即当你对他们说：“现在，关了你的电脑竹或者“因为你没碰晚餐，饭后不许吃甜点”时，要让孩子觉得你不是闹着玩的前后一致的教育之道会让你的儿子或女儿知道，在他们做了错事，做了不适当的举止或不令人满意的行为之后，你会立刻有相应的反应。如果你教育孩子时缺乏前后一致的态度，你要直接为你孩子的错误行为负责，同时，你也无法教会他们如何为自己的行为负责。父母对规矩的态度保持一致也是十分必要的。如果父母中的一位很坚定而另一个太过宽容，儿子或女儿会钻此空子并试图利用这种优势加以操纵。父母必须事先对规矩达成一致，并相互承诺在实行时也步调相同，将相应的惩治结果实行到底。这实施起来对于离异的父母而言尤其困难。 (1)虽然你们不住在一起，但是父母间口径一致是十分关键的。(2)事先就此直接并诚实地与你的前任配偶达成一致，并告知你们的儿子或女儿，_旦他们做了破坏规矩的行为，惩治的效果就能充分实现。父母间任何的意见相左必须在孩子不在场时加以讨论。前后一致意味着要有决心，即使做起来非常费心、劳累。(3)有时这真的很困难：劳累了．一天回到家中，发现在家中，等待着你的是挑战——教育孩子。你的儿子或女儿会不停地探视惩罚的界限，想从你这里知道与此有关的事项，来看看做了这些事会有什么结果。有坚定的决心，你会让他们知道你并没有特别要求他们什么，只想让他们知道他们要为自己的行为负责。\\n====================\\nNO.2:\\nEnglish:\\nA man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps,for there is a companionship of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company, whether it be ofbooks or of menA good book may be among the best of ffiends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not tum its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age.Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a bookjust as two persons sometimes discover a friend by admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb,“ Love me, love my dog.\" But there is more wisdom in this: \" Love me,love my book.\" The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author.They live in him together, and he in them.A good book is otten the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out, for the world of a man\\'s life is, for the most part, but the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are treasuries of good words, the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters.Books possess an essence ofimmortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author\\'s minds, ages ago. The only effect of time have been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive e but what is really good.Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived.

A few seconds pass. He looks at her again. She starts to blush. He nervously looks at the ceiling and whistles softly to himself. They continue their cat-and-mouse game for a seemingly interminable period of time. Will they ever talk to each other?The fact is, they have already communicated a lot, without ever saying anything. Nonverbal elements form a major part of any communication change. Some people would say it\\'s the most\\nimportant part. According to one study, words convey only 7 percent of a person\\'s message. intonation and voice quality communicate 38 percent, and nonverbal cues transmit a whopping 55 percent. That means people pick up more from nonverbal communication than from the words a person says, When studying about a foreign culture then, it just makes sense to pay attention to how people use nonverbal cues.Gestures prise a major form of nonverbal communication. In contast to sign language, used by deaf people to communicate elaborate messages, gestures function as visual icons which represent a single idea. But often these gestures are embarrassingly culture-bound. For example,when the Maoris of New Zealand stick out their tongue at someone ,it is a sign of respect. When American schoolchildren make the same gesture, it means just the opposite. Also, Americans often indicate OK\" with their thumb and forefinger touching to form a circle. The same gesture means money\" to the Japanese, \"zero\" to the French and a \"vulgarity\" to Brazilians. For that reason, people in a foreign culture must use gestures with caution.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n那个男孩和女孩瞥视着那拥挤的屋子。他们的视线相遇.两个人都不好意思，于是又把视线挪开.惴惴不安地，他们互相偷看着，当发现对方也在回望自己时，他们又转移视线. 男孩表现得很酷，交叉着双腿，装着一副漫不经心的样子—虽然他的心正狂野地跳动着；女孩，很显然已坠人隋网，很怕男孩看到自己在看他。几秒钟过去了，他再一次看着她；她的脸红了起来。他紧张地看着天花板，自己轻吹着口哨。他们似乎没完没了地玩着这个猫捉老鼠的游戏。他们到底会不会交谈呢？事实上，他们已经沟通过了，即便一句话也没说。非语言要素在任何形式的双向沟通中都占了很重要的一部分。有些人会认为那是最重要的一部分。一项研究表明，言语只传达了7%的讯息，语调及音色传达了38%，而非语言的暗示传递了极大的55%o这就表明人们从非语言沟通中领悟到的比从说出来的话语中的还多。所以，在研究外国文化时，注意人们如何使用非语言暗示是很有道理的。体态是非语言沟通中很重要的一环。(2)与聋人用来沟通复杂讯息所使用的手语不同的是，体态的功能就像是视觉上的图像，它代表的是单一的意念。但往往这些体态极受文化的限制，甚至会造成尴尬的误解。例如，纽西兰的毛利人对某人伸舌头是尊敬的表现；而当美国学童作同样的动作时，它表达的意思却正好相反。还有，美国人通常用大拇指及食指环绕起一个圆圈表示“没问题“。同样的手势对日本人是“钱”的意思，对法国人是“零“的意思，对巴西人是极低俗的手势。因此，处在外国文化中的人必须小心地使用体态。\\n====================\\nNO.10:\\nEnglish:\\nChristmas in America means different things to different people.To some people, Christmas means brightly wrapped packages under a decorated tree. To others, it means family reunions and a wonderful meal together. To Christians, it means Jesus\\' birthday. Christmas also means lending a helping hand to people in need: Along with all the hubbub of shopping for presents and sending Christmas cards, many people in America take time to help others.In America and around the world, Christmas offers many opportunities to spread \"peace on earth, good will toward men\". For example, Salvation Army bell ringers are a familiar slght to most Christmas shoppers. They stand outside malls and stores collecting money for the needy. Many churches and other organizations collect toys and clothes as Christmas gifts for poor families. Going caroling is another traditional way to bring cheer to neiShbors-especially the elderly and people who can\\'t get out much. The Christmas spirit encourages people to help each other in many large and small ways.The spirit of helping others isn\\'t limited to Christmas ,however,Americans help others year-round. Civic clubs such as the Lion\\'s Club, theElk\\'s Club and the Rotary Club take part in local community projects. Manyorganizations exist just to help others. The Make a Wish Foundation gives terminaIly ill childrena chance to have their dreams come true. Habitat for Humanity helps poor people build their own houses. And besides supporting worthy causes with their money, thousands ofAmericans donate their time by serving volunteers in hospitals, homeless shelters and schools.As the old saying goes, \"Charity begins at home\" - but it doesn\\'t stop there. Americans are concerned about helping needy people in other countries, as weU. The U.S. is often one of the first countries to provide relief to areas of the world in severe need. Many American organizations reach out to suffering people in other countries. Some ofthem have programs by which\\ndonors can sponsor needy children For a certain amount per month, people can provide these children with food, clothing and education.Americans not only give money to help people in other countries,often they give themselves, as well. Many people serve as volunteers with the Peace Corps for two years to provide assistance in some needy part of the world. They dig wells, help people improve farming techniques, build medical clinics and teach English. In addition, thousands of nussionaries from America and other countries have devoted their lives to helping people. They have built schools, hospitals, orphanages and churches in order to share God\\'s love with those in need.As long as there are people in need, helping others will remain an important task. Americans are not the only ones who believe in helping others. People in every culture recognize that being helpful is one of the greatest virtues in life, as well as one of the sweetest joys.

They can even change your life. Especially if you say them at your own wedding.Making wedding vows is like signing a contract. Now Americans don\\'t really think marriage is a business deal. But marriage is serious business.It all begins with engagement. Traditionally, a young man asks the father of his sweetheart for permission to marry her. If the father agrees, the man later proposes to her. Often he tries to surprise her by “ popping the question\" in a romantic way. Sometimes the couple just decides together that the time is right to get married. The man usually gives his ficancee diamond nng as a symbol of their engagement. They may be engaged for weeks, months or even years. As the big day approaches, bridal showers and bachelor\\'s parties provide many useful gifts. Today\\nmany couples also receive counseling during engagement. This prepares them for the challenges of married life.At last it\\'s time for the wedding. Although most weddings follow long-held traditions, there\\'s still room for American individualism. For example, the usual place for a wedding is in a church. But some people get married outdoors in a sceruc spot. A few even have the ceremony while sky-diving or riding on horseback! The couple may invite hundreds of people or just a few close friends. They choose their own style of colors, decorations and music during the ceremony. But some things rarely change. The bride usually wears a beautiful, long white wedding dress. She traditionally wears \"something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue\", The groom wears a formal suit or tuxedo. Several close friends participate in the ceremony as attendants, including the best man and the maid of honor.As the ceremony begins, the groom and his attendants stand with the minister, facing the audience. Music signals the entrance of the bride\\'s attendants, followed by the beautiful bride. Nervously, the young couple repeats their vows. Traditionally, they promise to love each other \"for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health\". But sometimes the couple has composed their own vows. They give each other a gold to symbolize their marriage commitment. Finally the minister announces the big moment: \"I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride!\"At the wedding reception, the bride groom greet their guests.Then they cut the wedding cake and feed each other a bite. Guests mingle while enjoying cake, punch and other treats. Later the bride throws her bouquet of flowers to a group of single girls. Tradition says that the one who catches the bouquet will be the next to marry. reception, playful friends \"decorate\" the couple\\'s car with tissue paper, tin cans and a \"Just Mamed\" sign.When the reception is over ,the newlyweds run to their \"decorated\" car and speed off. Many couples take a honeymoon, a one- to two-week vacation trip, to celebrate their new marriage.Almost every culture has rituals to signal a change in one\\'s life. Marriageis one of the most basic life changes for people of all cultures. So it\\'s no Wise to find many traditions about getting married-even in America. Yet each couple follows the traditions in a way that is uniquely their own.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n“我愿意”这几个字对美国人来说包含着深远的意义，它甚至可以改变一个人的生活，特别是当你在自己的婚礼上说出这句话的时候。发出结婚誓言就如同签订契约一般。虽然今天美国人并不真正认为婚姻是一种商业交易，但婚姻确实是件严肃的事。一切从订婚开始。传统上来说，年轻男子先要请求女朋友的父亲允许自己娶她。如果女方的父亲答应，然后男方才能向女方求婚。男方时常尝试以罗曼蒂克的方式“蹦出这个问题竹，想给女方一个惊喜。有时双方只是一起决定该是结婚的时候了。男方通常会送给未婚妻一只钻石戒指作为订婚的象征。订婚期可以持续几个星期、几个月，甚至几年。当大喜的日子临近时，双方各自的好友在婚前的派对上会赠送许多实用的礼物。今天，许多未婚夫妻在订婚期间还听取咨询意见，以此为应付婚姻生活的挑战作好准备。最后就该举行婚礼了。虽然大多数的婚礼沿袭长期以来的传统，但是仍有发挥美国人的个性主义的余地。例如，通常举行婚礼的地点是在教堂，但是有些人却在户外的风景点举行婚礼，少数人甚至在跳伞或骑马时举办仪式！新人可以邀请几百个客人，也可以只邀请几个最要好的朋友。婚礼的色调风格、布置和音乐都由他们自己决定。．但有些事情很少会变化，新娘通常都穿一件漂亮的长长的白色结婚礼服。按传统习惯，新娘的穿着要包括“一点旧的、一点新的、一点借来的和一点蓝色的东西”。新郎则穿着一套正式的西装或无尾晚礼服。几位亲密的朋友参与婚礼作为陪伴，包括伴郎和伴娘。婚礼开始时，新郎和他的陪伴同牧师站在一起，面对着来宾。当音乐响起时，新娘的陪伴入场，后面就跟着美丽的新娘。—对新人紧张地跟着说出他们的誓言。按传统习惯，双方许诺要彼此相爱，“不论情况是好是坏，不论家境是富是穷，不论生病还是健糜竹o但有时两人也可以编一套自己的誓言。他们互赠金戒指象征婚姻的承诺。最后，牧师宣布重大时刻的到来：“我现在宣布你们成为夫妻。你可以亲吻你的新娘！在结婚喜宴上，新娘和新郎向宾客表示欢迎。然后他们切开结婚蛋糕并互喂对方一口。来宾们一边享受蛋糕、混合饮料和其他食物，一边相互交谈。之后，新娘将她的花束投向一群单身女孩。相传抓到花束的女孩会成为下一个结婚的人。喜宴期间，爱闹的朋友用薄纸、锡罐和写着“新婚斗的标牌来“装饰丹新人的小汽车。宴会结束后，新婚的小俩口就跑向他们“被装饰好的竹小汽车，并迅速地开走。许多新人会去度蜜月，即一两个星期的度假旅行，以庆祝他们的新婚。几乎每一种文化都有仪式来标志一个人生活的变化。婚姻对于各种文化的人而言都是最基本的生活变化之一。因此发现关于结婚有许多传统习俗，就不足为奇了—在美国也不例外。然而每对新人都会以自己独持的方式来继承传统。\\n====================\\nNO.12:\\nEnglish:\\nPeople have been passionate about roses since the beginning of time.In fact, it is said that the floors of Cleopatra\\'s palace were carpeted and that the wise and knowing Confucius had a\\n600-book library specifically on how to care for roses.The rose is a legend on its own. The story goes that during the RomanEmpire, there was an incredibly beautiful maiden named Rhodanthe.Her beauty drew many zealous suitors who pursued her relentlessly.Exhausted by their pursuit, Rhodanthe was forced to take refuge from her suitors in the temple of her friend Diana. Unfortunately, Diana became jealous. And when the suitors broke down her temple gates to get near their beloved Rhodanthe, she became angry tuming Rhodanthe into a rose and her suitors into thornsIn Greek legend, the rose was created by Chloris, the Greek goddess of flowers. It was just a lifeless seed of a nymph that Chloris found one day in a clearing in the woods. She asked the help of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who gave her beauty. Dionysus, the god of wine, added nectar to give her a sweet scent, and the three Graces gave her charm, brightness and joy. Then Zephyr, the West Wind, blew away the clouds so that Apollo, the sun god, could shine and made this flower bloom And so the Rose was born and was immediately crowned the Queen of Flowers.The frist true primary red rose seen in Europe was\"Slater\\'s Crimson China\" introduced in 1792 from China, where it had been growing wild in the mountains. Immediately, rose breeders began using it to hybridize red roses for cultivation. Ever since, the quest for the perfect red rose has been the Holy Grail ofrosarians: a fragrant, disease-resistant, long-lasting, Iong-stemmed, rebloaming, perfectly formed rose with a clear non-fading vivid red color. Absolute perfection still hasn\\'t been attained, and of course never will!There is a special rose language invented as a secret means of communication between lovers who were not allowed to express their love for one another openly. In the mid 18th century the wife of the British ambassador in Constantinople described this in her letters, which were published after her death. These letters inspired many books on the language of flowers, each describing the secret message hidden in each flower. A red rose bud stands for budding desire.An open white rose asks \"Will you love me?\" An open red rose means \"I\\'m full o flove and desire\",while an open yellow rose asks \"Don\\'t you love me any more?\"\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n人类有史以来就钟情于玫瑰。 据说，克娄巴特拉宫殿的地面就铺满了娇嫩的玫瑰花瓣，博学的孔子有600册藏书专门讲述如何培育玫瑰。玫瑰本身就是一个传说，在罗马帝国时代，有一个名叫罗丹斯的美丽绝伦的少女。她的美丽引来了无数狂热的求婚者锲而不合地追求她。罗丹斯实在招架不住了，不得不到朋友狄安娜的神庙里躲避她的求婚者。不幸的是，狄安娜产生了嫉妒之心。当求婚者冲进了神庙的大门，要接近他们所爱恋着的罗丹斯时，狄安娜一怒之下将罗丹斯变成了一枝玫瑰花，将她的求婚者变成了花刺。在希腊传说中，玫瑰是希腊花神克罗斯创造的。当初玫瑰只是林中一个仙女的尚无生命的一粒种子。一天，花神克罗斯偶然在森林的一块空地上发现了它。克罗斯请求爱神阿佛洛狄特赋予了它美丽的容貌，让酒神狄俄尼索斯浇洒了神酒，使它拥有了芬芳的气味。又有美惠三女神将魅力、聪颖和欢乐赐予了它。随后，西风之神吹散了云朵，太阳神阿波罗用光茫将其照耀并使它开花。玫瑰就这样诞生了，并立即被封为花中之皇后。欧洲见到的第一枝真正的原色红玫瑰叫做“斯莱特中国深红”，于1792年从中国引进。当时，它．直生长在中国山区的野地里口玫瑰培育者马上开始用它进行杂交种植。从此，寻求完美的红玫瑰一直是玫瑰栽培者所追求的理想。这种玫瑰应具有芳香的气味、抵御疾病的能力，持久的花期、修长的花茎、反复开花的本领、优美的体态以及不褪色的纯鲜红颜色。然而，绝对的完美却始终未达到，当然也永远无法达到！人们发明了_一种特殊的玫瑰语言，作为不被允许公开示爱的情侣间秘密交流的方式。18世纪中期，英国驻君士坦丁堡大使的夫人在信中对此做了描述。这些信件激发了许许多多关于花草语言书籍的问世，每一本书都对每种花所隐藏的信息进行了描述。一朵红玫瑰花蕾代表萌发中的情欲，一枝盛开的白玫瑰则是在探问：“你会爱我吗?井一枝绽开的红玫瑰的含义是：“我对你满怀着爱意和渴望竹，而一枝开放的黄玫瑰则是在询问：“你是不是不再爱我了？”\\n====================\\nNO.13:\\nEnglish:\\nThere are varying opinions as to the origin ofValentine\\'s Day.

Indeed, the very word Christmas means \"Christ festival\".Yet there can be little doubt that for many it is Santa Claus - not Jesus - who is the human face of Christmas. In fact, it is fair to say that in much of the world, Santa is better known than the Christ who gave his name to the holiday.But how did the fat man in the Coca-Cola red-and-white suit become the symbol of Christmas? The truth is that like the Christmas story itself, the story of Saint Nicholas is a composite of history, myth, and legend.According to tradition, he was born in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) in about A.D. 270. When young, he traveled to Palestine and Egypt. Not long afterward, he became a bishop.During the Roman emperor Diocletian\\'s bloody persecution of Christians in 303, Nicholas was imprisoned. Howeve r, when Constantine the Great became emperor in 306, he legalized Christianity and made it the officalreligion of the Roman Empire. Nicholas was freedThe scribes tell us that Nicholas\\'s prayers and leadership during the great tribulation led many to become Christians, Nicholas continued to serve as bishop for many years. On December 6, 343, Nicholas the man died, and Saint Nicholas the legend was born.During his lifetime, Nicholas\\'s reputation for generosity and kindness gave rise to stories of miracles he performed for the poor, the weak and children. After his death, devotion to Nicholas extended to all parts of Europe. His feast day was celebrated on December 6, but his reputation as a gift-giver later became attached to the celebration of Christmas on December 25.After the Reformation in the 16th century, Nicholas\\'s cult disappeared in most Protestant countries of Europe. But his legend was united with old Nordic folktales of a magician who punished naughty children and rewarded good children with presents. In England, he became known as Father Christmas. But in Holland, Saint Nicholas\\' name and reputation persisted as \"sinterklaas\".In the 17th century , Dutch colorusts took this tradition with them to America. Later, Sinterklaas was adopted by the English-speaking majority as¨Santa Claus\". The resulting image of a \"jolly old elf\\' driving a sleigh with \"eight tiny reindeef\\' crystallized in the 19th century . That was when Clement Moore wrote the now-famous poem \"A Visit From Saint Nick. And the red-and-white suit? That was created by a Coca-Cola adman in the 1930s.Although greatly commercialized, the modern Santa Claus still embodies Saint Nicholas\\' generosity and love for children. And for some, he still points to the Nativity of the babe in the manger, and reminds us of the reason we celebrate Christmas.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n圣诞节是庆祝基督——这名被基督徒视为上帝之子的婴儿在马槽里的诞生。的确，“圣诞节”这个词的意思就是“基督的庆典竹。然而，可能有许多人会有点疑惑，为什么圣诞节的代表人物是圣诞老人，而不是耶稣呢？事实上，这样说也不为过：在世界上许多地方，圣诞老人要比以其名字来命名该节日的基督还要出名。但是，那个穿着一套可口可乐红白颜色衣服的胖子是怎么成为圣诞节的象征的呢？事实上，跟圣诞节本身的故事一样，圣人尼古拉的故事，也是集历史、神话和传说于一身。按照传统的说法，公元270年，尼古拉出生于小亚细亚（现在的土耳其）。年轻时，他曾经到巴勒斯坦和埃及旅行。不久以后他成为了一名主教。公元3 03年，在罗马皇帝戴克里血腥迫害基督徒期间，尼古拉被捕入狱。然而，公元306年君士坦丁大帝登基称帝，他使基督教合法化，并\\n使之成为罗马帝国的国教，尼古拉也获释放。据史书记载，尼古拉在受难期间的祈祷和领导让很多人皈依成为基督教徒，（出狱后）尼古拉继续担任主教多年。公元343年12月6日，真人尼古拉去世，然而圣人尼古拉的传说诞生了。尼古拉在世时慷慨仁慈的名声衍生出他为穷人、弱者和孩子创造奇迹的许多故事。尼古拉死后，人们对他的挚爱延伸到欧洲各地。节日仪式定在12月6日举行，但是他作为“赠礼者”的声望，后来却与12月25日圣诞节的庆典扯上了关系。16世纪宗教改革运动以后，对尼古拉的膜拜便在多数欧洲新教国家销声匿迹了o但是有关他的传说却跟一个北欧民间故事结合了起来，故事中有位魔术师，他爱惩罚顽皮的孩子，并送礼物奖励好孩子。在英格兰，尼古拉成为家喻户晓的圣诞节之父。而在荷兰，圣人尼古拉的名声依旧以“Sinterklaas”的名字流传。17世纪，荷兰的殖民者将这个传统带到美洲。后来．“Sinterklaas”为多数说英语的人民所采用，并改成了“Santa Claus”，他最后的形象——“快乐的老矮”驾着“八只小驯鹿”拉的雪橇—是在19世纪开始变得明确具体起来的。摩尔(Clement Moore)就在那时写了《圣人尼克的来访》这首闻名至今的诗。还有那件红白套装呢？那是在20世纪30年代，可口可乐公司的广告商创造出来的。尽管现代的圣诞老人已经被高度商业化，但他仍旧表现了圣人尼古拉的宽大胸怀和对孩子们的爱。对某些人来说，他仍然象征着马槽里圣婴的诞生，并让我们想起庆祝圣诞节的缘由。\\n====================\\nNO.15:\\nEnglish:\\nSanta shot at in Rio.

In a recent survey seven out often adults said they went to pubs, one third of them once a week or more often.Everywhere there are plenty of pubs, in which people play darts, talk and drink, usually while standing up. Every pub has its name, its sign and its \"regulars\", its customers who turn up night after night. A few old pubs have real character but many are dull and ugly. It seems that the English think it rather indecent for people to drink alcoholic drinks in any place where they can be seen from outside. So pubs usually not only have no tables outside, but are so built that it is impossible for people outside to see in,or for those who are inside to see out. There are exceptions to this, but not many.Types of pubs vary considerably from quiet, rural establishments with traditional games, such as skittles and dominoes, to city pubs where different sorts of entertainment such live music can often be found. The opening hours of pubs, which were previously strictly controlled, have been relaxed and many pubs now serve food as well as drink.The traditional pub was a place for the men only. But things havechanged, and more and more pubs are now places where men and women sit at tables, and they often provide good lunches. Most of them have a public bar, where drinks are slightly cheaper, and a saloon bar, which middle-class people usually prefer because it is more comfortable and less crowded. Some\\npubs have become more welcoming to families with younger children than in the past, although children under fourteen are still not allowed in the bar.British drinking habits have changed with larger and continental beers now more popular than traditional fonns of British beer. In cities,wine bars have appeared in competition with pubs. Although, in general,people in Britain now drink more than they used to, new typesof drinks such as alcohol-free beer and wine have appeared and there has been a general move to educate people more about the dangers of drinking too much.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n去酒吧是一项非常流行的休闲活动。最近的一项调查显示7/10的成年人表示他们会去酒吧，1/3的人每周去一次或者更多。酒吧在英国随处可见。人们在那里站着玩飞镖、聊天或者喝酒。每个酒店都有自己的名字、自己的招牌和“常客竹（即那些每个晚上都会光顾的客人）。一些老店很有特色，但多数却是既无聊又丑陋。英国人似乎认为，在任何一个从外面看得见的地方喝酒都是件不体面的事。所以，这里的酒吧不仅外面不设桌子，而且它的建筑结构使你既不能从外面看到里面，也不能从里面看到外面。当然，这也有一些例外，但不多。有些酒吧比较安静，它们座落在乡下，客人在里面可以玩传统的游戏，例如九柱游戏和骨牌。城市的酒吧提供不同的娱乐，通常可以看现场音乐表演。酒吧的营业时间以前是严格控制的，现在则放宽多了’许多酒吧除了提供酒水外还供应食物。传统上的酒吧是男人的世界，但今天情况已发生了变化，在越来越多的酒吧里，你可以看见男人和女人同桌共饮，这些酒吧常常能提供很好的午餐。而且，大多数酒吧都设有一个公共酒吧区，那里的酒水相对而言比较便宜，此外，它们还设有一个沙龙酒吧区，那是中产阶级人士常常光顾的地方，那里不仅比较舒服，人也比较少，某些酒吧比过去更受到有小孩的家庭的欢迎，尽管14岁以下的小孩还是不能进酒吧的。英国人的喝酒习惯已经改变了很多，更大瓶的啤酒和大陆式啤酒现在比传统英国啤酒更受欢迎。在城市中，葡萄酒酒吧与酒馆互相竞争。虽然从总体上来说，英国人现在喝酒比以前多，但是已经出现新的没有酒精的酒类，并且人们越来越明白酒精以及酗酒的害处了.\\n====================\\nNO.17:\\nEnglish:\\nIn smoky clubs, bars and cafes across America and Europe people are all doing the same thing: enjoying the inventivesounds and style of jazz.Jazz is an advanced art form with a rich lustory . It has been called America\\'s classical music. Why? Well, for one, it\\'s been around for a long time-over 100 years. Also, its reputation for complicated improvisationmeans it\\'s often approved of by academics in a way that pop is not,New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. It started among the big brass bands of the city\\'s black ghettos at the end of the 19th century. The new music took inspiration from two very different musical traditions. It combined the rhythm of West African dance music with the harmony and melody of European classical.Common jazz instruments are trombones, tubas, saxophones and, of course, tmmpel Indeed, one ofjazz\\'s most infuential musicians was a trumpet player LouisArmstrong. He was the first importan tjazz soloist to emerge and is stillloved by fans, who fondly refer to him by his nickname \"Satchmo\".Jazz\\'s brass instruments are often played alongside drums and stringed instruments. However, the two key elements of jazz are swing and improvisation.Swing refers to the part of jazz that makes people want to dance. It is more a feeling than a specific sound. Jazz developed as music to dance to. The evolution of US \"swing\" bands like those led by Duke Ellington really amved during the 1930s.The other key aspect of jazz is improvisation. This means that you don\\'t have to play what is written. Jazz performers will start out playing an agreed song but aren\\'t expected strictly to follow the anticipated notes.Instead, they use their talent, creativity , and feeling to add new notes and sounds to the music as they are playing. That\\'s what jazz is all about: getting inspired, being inventive, and living for the moment.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n在美国和欧洲那些烟雾弥漫的俱乐部、酒吧和咖啡馆中，人们都在做着同一件事情：享受着爵士乐的独特乐音和曲调。爵士乐是一种高尚的、历史悠久的艺术形式。它曾被称做美国的古典音乐。为什么呢？原因之一是它的历史源远流长——有100多年之久。同时，它以复杂莫测的即兴创作著称，这意味着在某种方式上它总是能够得到学者们的认可，而流行音乐则不行。新奥尔良是爵士乐的发源地。爵士乐于19世纪晚期兴起于城市黑人区的大铜管乐队。这种新音乐的灵感来源于两种极其不同的音乐传统。它将非洲西部舞蹈音乐中的节奏和欧洲古典音乐中的和声和旋律结合在了一起。常见的爵士乐器有长号、大号、萨克斯管，当然还有小号。其实，最知名的爵士乐手之一就是一名小号手：路易斯·阿姆斯特朗。他是迄今涌现出的第一位重量级的爵士乐独奏家，现在仍然受到乐迷的推崇，他们亲切地称他为“书包嘴”爵士乐中的铜管乐器通常会和鼓以及弦乐器一起演奏。但是，爵士乐的两大基本要素是摇摆乐和即兴创作。摇摆乐是爵士乐的一部分，让人听了后想跳舞，它的旋律固然奇特，但其实它带给人们更多的是一种感觉。后来爵士乐逐渐发展成为跳舞的配乐。在20世纪30年代，艾灵顿公爵等人率领的美国“摇摆乐竹乐队发生了真正的变革。爵士乐的另外一个重要因素就是即兴创作。(这就意味着你不必按照事先写好的乐谱进行演奏。爵士乐演奏者会从一首熟悉的曲子开始演奏，但他们并不严格遵守预先的曲调。相反，他们在演奏中发挥他们的天分、创造力以及灵感，为音乐注入新的音韵和旋律。这就是爵乐：灵感迸发、充满创造力、为现时而奏。\\n====================\\nNO.18:\\nEnglish:\\nIt seems that hip-hop music is ubiqrutous these days, from popularradio to TV commercials. Whatever your opinion of hip-hop music may be, there is no denying it has impacted pop culture around the world, andshows no signs of slowing down.Hip-hop brings with it its own unique terminology. \" Rap\" is the literalaction of speaking over a beat.“Hip-hop\" is both a kind of music and a culture, which includes four main elements: \"emceeing\" (rapping over a beat), \"deejaying\" (spinning records and mixing samples), \"breaking\" (an acrobatic form of dance), and \"graffih art\". Along with these are other distinctive. aspects ofhip-hop culture such as language and fashion.Hip-hop has its roots in the African traditions of percussion and oral storytelling. Its modernorigins, however, can be found in New York City\\'s crime-ridden South Bronx in the early 1970s. Fed up with the insipid disco of the times, youth who were short on money but rich in ingenuity created a new, dynamic art form: verbally competing and chronfcling life in the ghetto by rapping poetry over a beat.The person regarded as the father of hip-hop is Kool Herc, a Jamaican who immigrated to New York at age 12. Around 1973, he began deejaying at house parties in the Bronx. To his infectious playlist of R&B, soul, and funk he added the Jamaican customs of \"toasting\" (talking to the crowd) and \"dub talk\" (speaking thythmically over a beat).Hip-hop culture\\'s positive energy was fostered by Afrika Bambaataa, a former gang leader and dj who is regarded as the godfather of hip-hop. His efforts brought together the burgeoning hip-hop community and inspired gangs to battle creatively through rapping and breaking rather than tbrough violence.In the 1980s, as hip-hop became more popular, new off shoots developed. East Coast styles were generally hard-core, with rappers espousing political and social ideals, often from an afro-centric perspective. West Coast hip-hop was heavy on gangster rap, filled with references to gangs, guns, and the inescapability of street life. The West Coast style caught the larger public\\'s imagination, and became wildly popular in urban and suburban areas alike.While some fans complain that today\\'s hip-hop has lost its edge and political message, the genre continues to expand, innovate, and influence. Through its brief history, hip-hop has gone from just two tumtables to samplers and live musicians; from rapping on a four count to increasingly complex verbal gymnastics; and from its roots in the South Bronx to the four comers ofthe world.\"Run\" of the East Coast hip-hop band Run DMC once said that when people called hip-hop a fad, they had no idea of the passion that lay behind it. Once considered a flash in the pan, hip-hop is set to continue its path of creation and celebration,bringing more and more converts along for the ride.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n现在，从大众广播到电视广告，嘻哈音乐似乎无所不在。不管你对嘻哈音乐的看法怎么样，无可否认它已经对世界各地的通俗文化造成了冲击，并且没有减弱的迹象。嘻哈风带来了一些专有术语：“说唱乐”是指配合节奏念文字的动作。“嘻哈”既是一种音乐，同时也是一种文化，嘻哈文化包含4大要素“MC\"（随节奏说唱）、“DJ”（转动唱片及混音）、“霹雳舞”（一种特技般的舞蹈），和“涂鸦艺术_o除此之外嘻哈文化还有其他一些特殊\\n的方面，如语言和服装时尚等。嘻哈文化起源于非洲传统的打击乐和口述故事。然而，现代嘻哈则是20世纪70年代初期来源于纽约市犯罪行为猖獗的南布朗克斯区。那些口袋空空却富于创新的年轻人，厌倦了当时流行的乏味的迪斯科音乐，便创造出了-一种新的动感十足的艺术形式：通过配合节奏念词的方式，在言辞上相互较量，并且记录了贫民区的生活。被公认为嘻哈之父的库尔·贺克是牙买加人，他是12岁移民到纽约的。1973年左右他开始在布朗克斯区的家庭宴会中担任DJ。在他主持的节奏布鲁斯、灵歌和方克舞等极富感染力的节目里，他还加入了“toasting”（对群众说话）和“dub talk”（跟着拍子有节奏地讲话）等牙买加风俗节目。培养嘻哈文化的正面力量要归功于曾做过帮派头目和DJ的阿弗里卡·班巴塔，他被公认为嘻哈文化的教父。他不仅努力把迅速发展的嘻哈音乐团体团结起来，而且还激励帮派份子在说唱和霹雳舞上进行创造性的互相较量，而不是通过暴力。80年代，随着嘻哈风更加盛行，新的流派发展起来。总的来说东岸风格是核心力量，说唱歌手通常以非洲为中心的角度，拥护政治和社会理想政治和社会理想。西岸的嘻哈风主要是帮派份子的说唱，充满了关于帮派、枪枝和不可避免的街头生活等内容。西岸风格引起了更多群众的兴趣，所以在都市和近郊地区都很受欢迎。尽管有些嘻哈迷抱怨说，现在的嘻哈文化中，原有的锐气和政治信息已经没有了\\'但这种类型仍在不断扩展、革新并且发挥其影响力。在其短暂的历史中，嘻哈文化从仅有两个唱机转盘发展到了混音器和现场演奏的乐手；从4拍子的说唱到越来越复杂的嘴上功夫，从南布朗克斯的发祥地到世界的每个角落。东岸嘻哈乐团“Run DMC竹中的“Run”曾说：在有些人称嘻哈只是一种时尚时，他们根本不了解它背后的热情。一度被视为昙花一现的嘻哈风，却决心继续走他的创造与赞美之路，并带领更多的归附者上路。\\n====================\\nNO.19:\\nEnglish:\\nFew words in the English language have such a special meaning.Home is a place where you can relax, kick back and just be yourself. Just about everyone bas a strong opinion of what makes a house a home. And for most people in America, home should be, above all, comfortable.Americans like their homes to refiect their personal tastes. Many do-it-yourselfers enjoy fixing up their house and making it more \"livable\".They often try to create a cozy atmosphere so that when they\\'reat home, they\\'ll really feel“at home\". Sofas and lounge chairs may be heavily padded and arranged in groupings conducive to relaxed conversation. The bathroom even receives special attention. Carpeted floors, scented soaps, colorful wall paper and decorative curtains adorn the \"comfort room\" in many homes. And on average, Americans have more bathrooms than any other people in the world.Lisa Marie Odegard, an interior designer in Bozeman, Montana, comments that \"a home is a haven. People want an open, easy feeling to make their homes comfortable\". For that reason, many new homes now have big, open kitchens and vaulted ceilings.Americans try to make the most of their space, too. The majority of homes have built-in closets and shelves, and people spare no pains to add dressers, filing cabinets and closet organizers to maximize their storage space. Although keeping the house neat is ofien a constant battle,Americans feelit\\'s a attle worth fighting.People in America keep an eye on the latest trends in interior design.In the 80s, the \"country\" look dominated the home decorating scene, Rustic funuture and shelves full of old-fashioned knick-knacks created a homey atmosphere remiruscent of ruralAmerica several generations back. The 90s have brought in another longing for the past: the retr0 50s and 60s look- plain and simple furniture with square backs and arms and block-style legs.Some parts of the country have their own regional preferences. In the western Uruted States, home owners favor the Navajo Indian style of the Southwest or the cowboy look. In contrast, Easterners prefer French Country or more \"fussy\" styles.With all this attention to their homes, you would think Americans place a high premium on housekeeping. In fact, however, keeping house doesn\\'t receive as much attention as it used to. Why? The fast-paced lifestyles of the 90s allow little spare time for dusting, vacuuming and scrubbing the tub. Ironically，however, even though more and more women work outside the home, women still do twice as much house work as men. Modem conveniences like the washing machine, the vacuum cleaner, and the dishwasher have taken some of the drudgery out of\\nhousehold chores. But in general, Americans these days take their cue from books like How to Avoid Housework.As a result, you might think American homes of the 90s are less than spotless. Witness the fact that sales of household cleaning products have declined in recent years. Besides that, Americans seem to be less persnickety about their housecleaning-especially in areas that nobody sees. Vacuum under the sofa? Dust the baseboards? Are you kidding? Ironically, though, American women seem quite satisfied with their housekeeping, according to a national survey conducted in 1995-96. Besides that, people are designing their homes with low-maintenance features-tile in bathrooms and kitchens as well as marble on countertops-to cut down on the need for frequent cleaning. Even so,more and more people are hiring outside help to clean their houses. ARoper poU found that one in six Americans hired cleaning help last year,up from one in 10 in 1986. One professional housecleaning service, MerryMaids, has grown to over 800 francluses in recent years.In a pre-Revolutionary War speech in 1761, James Otis made thefamous remark that \"a man\\'s home is his castle\". Americans like their castle to be as comfortable as possible. They would like to have a home they can be proud of, a place they can call their own. Not every one\\'s home looks like a castle, but \"be it ever so humble, there\\'s no place like home\".\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n在英文中没有几个字像家这个字一样有着特别的意义。家是一个你可以放松、做回你自己的地方。大概每个人对于如何把一间屋子变成一个家都非常有主见。对于大多数的美国人来说，家最重要的应该是舒适。美国人喜欢让家反映出他们个人的品味。许多喜欢自己动手人沉醉于修补他们的房子并让它更“适于居住竹” 他们常试着营造一个温暖而舒适的气氛，这样当他们待在家时，会真的感觉到“毫无拘束”。沙发及安乐椅可能会被铺上厚厚的垫子，并运用不同空间组合的摆设，让坐的人可以轻松地谈话。甚至连浴室他们也颇费心思：铺有地毯的地板、香气四溢的肥皂、彩色的壁纸及装饰窗帘，如此就打扮出了许多家庭的“舒服之地”。平均来说，美国人拥有的浴室比世界上其他的人都多。蒙大拿州柏斯曼的一位室内设计师丽莎·区迪嘉谈到：“家是一个避难所。人们想要一个开放、轻松的感觉来让他们的家变得很舒适。”因为这个原因，现在许多新房子都有大而开放的厨房以及拱形的屋顶。美国人也试着将空间做最佳的利用。 大多数的家庭都有壁橱以及架子，人们也不辞辛劳地添加橱柜、文件柜以及壁柜分隔架来加大储藏空间。虽然让房子维持整洁像是一场永无止尽的长期战役，但美国人觉得它是一场值得打下去的战役。美国人也会注意室内设计的最新时尚。80年代，“乡村竹风貌主导了家庭装潢；摆满旧式风格的小摆设的质朴家俱及架子，创造出一种会令人想起几代人以前以农业为主的美国之家庭气氛。90年代又带入另一个怀J日情愫：回溯到50及60年代风貌——有四方形靠背、把手以及有方正桌脚的朴素、简单的家俱。国内某些地方的人们有他们自己地区性的偏好，在美国西部，屋主们喜欢西南部印地安拿佛和族或是牛仔式的风格。相对的，东部人喜欢法国乡村或是更漂亮的形式。在他们家花了这么多的心思，你大概会认为美国人非常重视家庭的打理与清洁，但是事实上，整理家务已不像以前一样受重视。为什么呢？90年代步调快速的生活方式几乎没有留什么时间掸灰尘、吸尘以及刷洗浴缸。 然而，讽刺的是，即使越来越多的妇女在外工作，她们还是比男人多做两倍的家务。虽然像是洗衣机、吸尘器和洗碗机等现代家电已经替代了处理家务事中一些乏味、辛苦的工作。但一般而言，美国人今天已会向 《如何避免家务》这类的书来求救。因此，你可能会认为90年代的美国家庭大概不是一尘不染。由家用清洁产品的销售量在近几年呈下降的趋势便可见一斑。此外，美国人似乎对于家庭的清洁不那么吹毛求疵了——特别是对那些没有人会看到的地方。吸沙发下的灰尘？掸脚板？你在开玩笑吗？（他们是不会做的）但可笑的是，根据1995～1996年做的一项全国性调查，美国妇女似乎对他们的家务整理挺满意。除此之外，人们不再选择需要时时清洁的材料来设计他们的家-—在浴室及厨房贴磁砖以及做大理石的台面——一以减少打扫的次数。即使如此，越来越多的人还会雇用外人来协助清理屋子。一项洛普民意调查发现，去年有1／6的美国人雇用清洁服务，较1986年的1/10比率上升了许多。一个专业性的家务清理服务“陕乐女佣公司\"在最近几年已发展到拥有800多家的连锁店。在1761年独立战争前的一次演说中，詹姆士·欧提斯留下卜句名言一“男人的家是他的城堡”。美国人喜欢他们的城堡能够尽可能的舒适，他们都想要有一个引以为荣的家，一个可以属于他们自己的港湾。并不是每个人的家都看起来像是一座城堡，但是“即使是非常简陋，也没有一个地方可以比得上家”\\n====================\\nNO.20:\\nEnglish:\\nA love of sport has been characteristic in Highland and Lowlands alike.

Nearly every village in England, has its own cricket club. A first-class match lasts for up to five days, with six hours play on each dayHowever, for the majority of the British public the eight months ofthe football season are more important than the four months of cricket.Professional football is always a big business. The Cup Final, which isplayed in May each year in London, is the greatest event of the season andone ofthe most famous football matches in the world.Rugby football is played with an egg-shaped ball. It can be adangerous game as players wear no protective clothing. This form of sport got its name because it originated from the famous Rugby Public School.The sport is favoured by the middle class and it is also the game played at the great majority of \"public schools\".Most secondary schools have playing fields, and boys usually play rugby or football in winter and cricket in summer as a normal school activity ; while schoolgirls play tennis and a sort of baseball in summer and netball and hockey in winter. Men\\'s basketball is almost unknown.The more social adult games of golf and tennis are played by great numbers of people. Golf courses are also meeting places of the business community. It is, for example, very desirable for bank managers to play golf. Moreover, there are plenty of tennis clubs. Every town provides numerous tennis courts in public parks, and anyone can play tennis cheaply.Next to Association Football, the chief spectator sport in English life is horse racing. Their horse racing mainly takes place on working days and during working hours. The whole atmosphere of a race meeting still belongs in some ways to the eighteenth century with old divisions between upper and lower people. Every day people all over the country bet on the day\\'s races.Although the British are so fond of watching horses racing, they are not very interested in being spectators at occasions when human beings race together. Remarkably few people are interested in bicycle racing. On the other hand, rowing, in fours or eights, occupies a leading place in thesporting life of schools and universities which have suitable water near by. It is watched from the river banks by vast crowds of spectators.When English people use the word \"hunting\" they usually mean foxlumting, a sport which is popular among a small but important nunority . Thereare many people who would like to see fox-hunting forbidden by law on the ground that it is crueL but there is little possibility that this will be done.The moorlands of the north and of Scotland are rich in grouse andpartridge. And to go shooting on the moors is perhaps the most distinctiveof upper-class activities. The opening of shooting season on August 12thattracts many top people to the moors. They pay enormous amounts fortheir pleasure. Being afraid of losing votes, modem leaders do not shoot, or ifthey do they try their best to avoid the photographers.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n英国人是竞技运动的爱好者,他们就会谈论和思考它们。当他们不打球和不看比赛的时候.英国特有的运动是板球。在英格兰，几乎每个村子都有自己的板球俱乐部.一场一流的比赛要持续长达5天的时间，每天要打上6个小时。不过，对于多数英国人来说，前后长达8个月的足球季节要比4个月的板球更加重要。职业足球是一个大的体育项目。每年5月在伦敦举行的足总杯是足球赛季的头等大事，也是全世界最闻名的足球赛事之一。英式橄榄球使用的是一个鸡蛋形的球，由于球手不穿防护外衣，使得该项运动成为一种很危险的运动。这种运动因发源于著名的拉格比公学而得名。该项运动深受中产阶层的喜爱，在很多著名的公学中都很流行。多数中学中都设有动场地，男生们通常在冬季打橄榄球或足球，在夏季一般打板球。女生们在夏天打网球和一种垒球，在冬天则是打无挡板篮球和曲棍球。至于男式篮球，基本上可以说是无人问津的。比较社会化的成人运动是高尔夫球和网球，打这两种球的人很多。高尔夫球场还是很重要的商业交往中心，像银行经理这样的人就很喜欢打高尔夫。此外，网球俱乐部也随处可见，每个镇上的公园里都有网球场，人们不用花太多钱就能打场网球。除了英式足球以外，英国生活中一项重要的观看运动便是赛马。‘大多数的赛马比赛都在工作日和工作时间举行。而且，在很大程度上，赛马场上的气氛仍像18世纪那样，上流社会和普通平民是分开的。每天，全国各地都有人在当天的赛马比赛上赌上一把。虽然英国人那么热衷于观看赛马，但他们对人类的赛跑却不感兴趣。喜欢自行车赛的人更是罕见。但另一方面，4人或8人的划船比赛却在邻近水域的学校和大学里占有很重要的地位，比赛时，河两岸会有大群的观众观看助阵。英国人提到“打猎”时，他们通常指的是猎狐。喜爱这种运动的人很少，但他们都是英国社会中举足轻重的人。今天虽然有很多人认为猎狐残酷而违背人性并主张立法禁捕，不过，这一主张实现的可能性却很小。英国北部和苏格兰的沼泽地区有很多山鸡和山鹑，在沼泽地里打鸟也许是最典型的上流运动。每年月12日打猎季节开始后，便有很多上流人士云集此地，不惜千金来追求此项享受。现代领导人由于害怕失去选票一般不再打猎，如果打，他们也尽量避开照相机的镜头。\\n====================\\nNO.22:\\nEnglish:\\nTo the uninitiated, rugby is a game in which a bunch of powerfully built men throw themselves at one another in pursuit of an oval ball. Infact, this ancestor of modernAmerican and Canadian football can seemmore like an organized brawl than a highly technical sport with a complex set of rules. Apart from its sometimes chaotic demeanor, rugby is alsounusual among modern sports in that its origins can be traced back to asingle, seminal event.In 1823, during a soccer game at the prestigious Rugby School in central England, one of the players impulsively picked up the ball andran with it. The way soccer was played in those days, William Webb Ellis\\'rash action was practically suicidal. But his novel approach was taken upby other students, who went on to develop a new style of football. Known as Rugby football, it mainly involved throwing and running with the ball rather than kicking it.The game grew in popularity, and in 1871, the Rugby Union was formed in London. It drew up the modern rules for a 15-a-side game using an oval ball. Nowadays, rugby is played in more than 80 countries around the world. As for William Webb Ellis, his spirit lives on. His name has been given to the trophy awarded to the winners of the quadrennial Rugby World Cup tournament.For young men in New Zealand, the pinnacle of sporting achievement is widely reckoned to be donning the famous black uniform of the nationalrugby team. Ever since 1905, when the first officially sanctioned New Zealand touring team swept aside all opposition on a tour of Britain, the fearsome All Blacks have retained an aura ofinvincibility that has rarely been overcome.Such is the reputation of the All Blacks that some believe they gain a psychological advantage over their opponents the moment they step out onto the playing field. If such an advantage really exists, it can only be enhanced when, as tradihon dictates, the team performs the celebrated haka before the match kicks off.Haka is the generic term for a traditional dance of the Maori people. Its connection with the game of rugby goes back to the late 19th century,when the New Zealand Native Team performed one on an unofficial tour of Bri.tain. Nowadays, the haka is still led by a player of Maori descent whenever and wherever the All Blacks take the field.While recent years have seen the All Blacks struggling to match their past successes, the emergence of skillful p_rofessionals such asTongan-bom winger Jonah Lomu ensures that the famous black jersey with the silver fem on the left breast is still able to instill awe in opponents and spectators alike.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n在外行的眼中，橄榄球赛只不过是一大群身材健壮的男人相互冲撞推挤，为了一颗椭圆形的球你争我夺的比赛。事实上，这个现代美国和加拿大地区足球的始祖，看起来更像是一场有组织的争吵，而不像是遵循复杂规则、讲究高度技巧的运动。 与其他现代运动相比较，橄榄球的不寻常之处，除了屡见不鲜的混乱场面之外，还在于它的起源，它可以追溯到某—重要的事件。1823年，一场英格兰中部享有盛名的拉格公学(Rugby School)举行的足球赛中，一名球员一时冲动，把球拿起来带着跑。以当时的足球玩法，威廉·韦伯·艾利斯的鲁莽行动无疑是“自寻死路”。但他的这种新打法竟被其他学生接过来，继而发展成一种新式的足球——被称为橄榄球(Rugby football)，它以传球和带球跑为主，而不去踢球。这项运动日见普及，到1871年，“橄榄球联盟”在伦敦成立，并拟定了现代的规则：每队15人，使用椭圆形球比赛。现今，世界上有80多个国\\n家举行橄榄球赛。至于艾利斯本人，他的精神将永存。4年一次的世界杯橄榄球锦标赛的奖杯就是以“威廉·韦伯·艾利斯杯”命名的。对新西兰的年轻人来说，运动生涯的最高成就，就是能穿上那套出名的橄榄球国家代表队的黑色制服。 自1905年第一支正式批准的新西兰代表队远征英国参加巡回比赛并横扫所有对手、大获全胜以来，这支令人生畏的“全黑”就保持了几乎不可战胜的气势。这就是“全黑队”的名声，有些人认为，他们走上球场的那一刻，就在心理上压倒了对手。如果这样的优势真的存在，当这支队伍在传统的指引下，在比赛前跳起著名“哈卡”舞时，这种优势才能得到加强。“哈卡”是毛利人．种传统舞蹈的通称。它与橄榄球运动的联系可以追溯到19世纪末，新西兰土著球队在英国各地进行非正式比赛期间表演了这种舞蹈。现在，不论何时何地，只要“全黑”参加比赛，就会有一名毛利人后裔球员带头跳“哈卡”舞。近几年，“全黑队”想努力恢复旧日荣光，球技超群的职业球员如汤加出生的侧翼大将乔纳-洛姆等的一一出现，可以保证这件著名的左胸前镶有银蕨 的黑色球衣还是能让敌手胆战心惊、让观众肃然起敬的。\\n====================\\nNO.23:\\nEnglish:\\nIn 1869 British MP John Stuart Mill was the first person in Parliament to call for women\\'s right to vote. On 19 September 1893 New Zealand became the first country in the world to give women the right to vote.Women in other countries did not enjoy this equality and campaigned for justice for many years.In 1910 a second International Conference of Working Women was held in Copenhagen. A woman named Clara Zetkin (Leader of the\\'Women\\'s Office\\' for the Social Democratic Pafly in Germany) tabled the idea of an hiternational Women\\'s Day, She proposed that every year in every country there should be a celebration on the same day-a Women\\'s Day-to press for their demands. The conference of over 100 women from 17 countries, representing unions, socialist parties working women\\'s clubs, and including the first three women elected to the Finnish\\nparliament, greeted Zetkin\\'s suggestion with unanimous approval and thus Intemational Women\\'s Day was the result.The very first International Women\\'s Day was launched the following year on 19 March (not 8 March). The date was chosen because on 19 March in the year of the 1848 revolution, the Prussian king recognized for the first time the strength of the armed people and gave way before the tbreat of a proletarian uprising. Among the many promises he made, which he later failed to keep, was the introduction of votes for women， Plans for the first International Women\\'s Day demonstration were spread by word of mouth and in the press. During the week before International Women\\'s Day two journals appeared: The Vote for Women in Germany and Women\\'s Day in Austria. Various articles were devoted to Intemational Women\\'s Day: \\'Women and Parliament\\', “The WorkingWomen and Municipal Affairs\\', \\'What Has the Housewife got to do with Politics?\\', etc. The articles thoroughly analyzed the question of the equality of women in the government and in society .All articles emphasized the same point that it was absolutely necessary to make parliament more democratic by extending the franchise to women.Success of the first International Women\\'s Day in 1911 exceeded all expectation. Meetings were organized everywhere in small towns and even the villages halls were packed so full that male workers were asked to give up their places for women. Men stayed at home with their children for a change, and their wives, the captive housewives, went to meetings.During the largest street demonstration of 30,000 women, the policed.ecided to remove the demonstrators\\' banners so the women workers made a stand.

The company owes its success to its dynanuc approach to business and careful attention to its customers\\' needs.In Lavazza\\'s store, coffee was sold raw and then roasted according to each customer\\'s personal preference. Luigi Lavazza was considerably skilled at carefully selecting the amount of each ingredient required for one particular blend as well as expertly determining the degree of roasting.Over the next sixty years, the company experienced rapid commercial growth with its foray into the wholesale market and its decision to narrow down its range of products. By the mid forties, the company, now Luigi Lavazza S.P.A, began specializing in the production of coffee.The firm continued expanding by leaps and bounds, and introduced the first vacuum-packed coffee with a long shelf life in the sixties. Distribution soon covered all ofltaly, and the next two decades saw the conquering of both European and world markets.

We often consider ourselves \"the descendants of the dragon\". It is not unfamiliar to you that your parents hope that you \"may become the dragon\",As a mythical creature, the dragon is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Traditionally, dragons are considered to govern rainfall. They have the power to decide where and when the rain falls. Jn addition, the dragon is a symbol of imperial power. The emperors thought they were real dragons and the sons of the heaven.While Chinese believe dragons bring prosperity and good fortune, the creature is regarded differently Westem countries. In the Bible, dragons represent the devil and they trick the world. \"Western people usually see dragons as cold-blooded reptiles, like snakes,\" said Jonathan Haagen, copy editor for the Teens. \"They are cruel killers, breathing fire and capturing women.\" He added that people think of dragons as being dishonest because of their forked tongues.More often than not, dragons in Western literature are presented as monsters against which the hero must battle. It is a common tale for a mediaeval knight to kill a dragon and save a princess and her country from its evil. Even the popular boy wizard Harry Potter has to battle a deadly dragon and get back a golden egg from its nest in \"llarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\",So, some Chinese experts have suggested changing the English translation of dragon to \"Loong\". They believe the misunderstanding of the dragon is due to the translation.However, dragons are not all bad in the West.“Puff the Magic Dragon\" is a well-known song. The lyries tell a bitter-sweet story of the dragon Puff and his playmate Jackie Paper, a little boy. When Jackie grows up, he loses interest in the imaginary adventures of childhood and leaves Puff upset. \"Puff represents the innocence of a child\\'s imagination , which is very positive for a dragon,\" said Haagen.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n假如有人问你，哪些东西能够代表中国，龙可能会是浮现在你脑海里的一个答案。我们中国人经常称自己为“龙的传人” 而且你也知道父母都“望子成龙”作为一个神秘的生物，龙深深地植根于中国文化之中。人们通常认为龙是主管降雨的神，他们有权力决定下雨的时间和地点。而且，龙还是皇权的象征，皇帝都认为自己是真龙天子。中国人认为龙会带来繁荣和好运，而西方人并不认同这点。在圣经里，龙是邪恶势力的代表，并经常给世界捣乱。《21世纪中学生英文报》编辑乔纳森·哈根说：“西方人通常将龙视为和蛇一样的冷血爬虫。他们是残忍的杀人魔鬼，能够喷火，还掠取妇女”竹他还补充说，龙有叉形的舌头，所以人们认为龙不诚实。在很多情况下，西方文学把龙描写成为英雄要铲除的怪物。一个司空见惯的传说是，一位中世纪的骑士杀死了龙，拯救了公主和她的国家。甚至在著名的小说《哈里波特和火焰杯》里，小巫师哈里·波特也要打败一条凶恶的龙，以从它的巢穴里抢回金蛋。所以，有些中国专家建议将龙的英文翻译“dragon”改为“Loong”他们认为，西方关于中国龙的种种误解都是由于翻译错位产生的。然而，西方世界当中的龙并不全是坏蛋。有一首非常著名的歌曲叫做《神奇龙》，它的歌词描写了一头叫做波夫的龙和其小男孩玩伴杰克。派波之间的甜蜜而又痛苦的故事。杰克长大之后就对孩童时这位虚幻的玩伴失去了兴趣，这让波夫非常伤心。哈根说，“波夫代表了儿童纯洁的想象力，这是龙的一个非常正面的形象。”\\n====================\\nNO.26:\\nEnglish:\\nA British train station has erected a no kissing sign to stop lovers going full steam ahead with their over-amorous farewells.Commuters have been told: if you want to get up to that kind of business, do it in the car park.The sign has gone up at the drop-off point at Warrington Bank Quay station in the town of Warrington, between Liverpool and Manchester in northwest England.A man in a hat and a woman with a curly-looking hair do puckering up show people where they must not indulge in full-on lip -locking.A similar sign, this time permitting kissing, has been erected else where in a zone where smooching isconsidered tolerable,\"We have not banned kissing in the station,\" said a spokesman for operators Virgin Rail.\"But we have put the sign up at the drop-off point because it is not a very big area and it often gets busy with lots oftraffic.\"\"The sign is a light-hearted way ofgetting people to move on quickly.\"\"If people wish to spend a little more time with their loved ones before they leave, then they should park in the short-stay car park nearby.\"However, one station is trying to rescue love from the tracks,High Wycombe, northwest of London, is having none of it and is actively urging commuters to get frisky.\"Kissing is welcome here! ...we would never dream ofbanning kissing,\"says a poster ofa cartoon couple embracing, framed by a pink heart.\"Railway stations are romantic places,\" insisted Kirsteen Robertson from Chiltern Railways.\"They are where fond farewells and emotional reunions take place, where relationships start with a glance and even, in the case of our Marylebone station last November, where one passenger will propose to another over the public address system.\"\"So our passengers are more than welcome to share alass in our stations.\"\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n英国一家火车站日前贴出禁止接吻的标识，以防止恋人们在依依惜别时过于忘情（而造成站台拥堵）。车站规定：如果你想\"那个\"，请去停车场。位于英格兰西北部沃灵顿的Bank Quay车站最近在落客区张贴了这个“禁吻\"标识。沃灵顿位于利物浦和曼彻斯特之间。在标识上，头戴礼帽的男士和卷发女士正在亲吻，以此来提醒人们请勿在此处接吻。而车站还在另一个区域同时贴出了_一个类似的标识，不过这个是表示允许接吻的。Virgin铁路运营公司的一位发言人说：“我们并没有完全禁止接吻。 ”“但我们在落客区贴了禁吻标识，因为这块区域本来就不太大，来往车辆又很多，所以总是拥挤不堪。”“这一标识用一种轻松幽默的方式提醒人们尽陕上车。”“如果人们在上车之前想和爱人再多待一会儿，可以把车停到附近的短时停车场。”而另一个车站则试图拯救“站台爱情”。伦敦西北部的海·威科姆车站不但不禁止接吻，还积极鼓励人们享受爱情。这家车站贴了一张粉色心形海报，海报上有_对卡通人物在拥吻，旁边的文字这样写道：“这里欢迎接吻！我们从没想过要禁吻。\"奇尔顿铁路公司的克里斯汀·罗伯森称：\"火车站是浪漫的地方。\"\"这里上演着依依惜别、激动的重逢和爱情的邂逅，去年1 1月在我们的马瑞里本车站，一名乘客通过车站广播向自己心爱的人求婚。\"“所以我们非常欢迎旅客们在车站亲吻.\"\\n====================\\nNO.27:\\nEnglish:\\nA busker is someone who performs music or an act on the street.

Other theories about Stonehenge are that it was a religious site or that it acted as a calendar.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n考古学家们于本周一公布，英国最著名的史前遗址巨石阵可能是古代病人的朝圣地。据推测，巨石阵的石头可能被史前人类当作是具有治疗功效的幸运石。长期以来，人们—直很困惑，为什么人们要把巨石阵里的一种蓝色小石头从155英里以外的威尔士普利斯里山运到英格兰南部威尔特郡这里昵？伯恩茅斯大学的考古学家们推测，可能当时的人们信奉这些蓝色的石头具有神奇疗效。考古学家于今年4月对史前巨石阵进行了自1964年以来的首次发掘。该考古小组在一份声明中说：“巨石阵曾经可能只是个纪念碑，但这些具有魔力的石头被搬来之后，这里就变成了新时器时代伤病者的朝圣地。 ” 伦敦古文物学会主席、考古小组专家杰弗里‘韦恩莱特在接受BBC广播的采访时说，得出这一结论的其中一个根据就是，巨石阵附近埋葬了很多伤残者。考古学家在一份声明中说，经放射性碳测年法鉴定，环形巨石阵应该建造于公元前2400年至公元前2200年之间，比之前的推测晚了几百年。但考古学家还在此发现了公元前7000年前的木炭碎片，这说明在更早的时期已有人类活跃在这一地带。考古人员还在发掘过程中发现了大口陶器杯的碎片、古罗马陶器以及古石锤，位于索尔兹伯里平原的史前巨石阵现在已被列入世界文化遗址。韦恩莱特说：\"现在我们知道了\\'巨石阵不仅是史前的纪念碑，也是古罗马和中世纪时期的祭坛，这个发现让我们十分惊喜。\"考古小组的另一位专家、伯恩茅斯大学的蒂姆·达维尔说，巨石阵可能有多种功能，但蓝色小石头应该是其功能的一个重要体现。其他理论认为，巨石阵曾是个宗教场所或是一个日历等等。\\n====================\\nNO.33:\\nEnglish:\\nSuprises often come in boxes. Birthday presents wrapped in colorful paper, brown paper packages mailed from a friend. No matter what kind of box it is, people like to open it up and see what\\'s inside. In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It\\'s called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course oflustory.Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means \"the people rule\", an important concept in America\\'s history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colorues angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the govemment of England didn\\'t represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government.An effective democracy holds regular elections. In Amcrica, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the poUs to elect the nation\\'s president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law.In the American electoral system, people don\\'t really vote for presidential c:indldates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for \"electors”who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number ofits representatives in the House (which is based on the state\\'s population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state\\'s electors.To win the presidentrial election, a candidate must Sain at least 270 0f the 538 total electoral votes.Over the years, the U.S. has made a number of election reforms.Some early reforms outlawed cheating, giving bribes and threatening voters. They also limited the amount of money candidates could receive from donors and spend on theircampaigns. In 1870, black people gained the right to vote, and in 1920, that right was extended to women. In recent decades, laws against unfair rules for voting have been passed.No longer do people have to pay a special tax or pass a test in order to vote.In 1971, the voting age was lowered t0 18. Other reforms made votmg easier for the blind, the disabled and people who couldn\\'t read. In some areas, ballots had to be printed in languages besides English.In November, Americans will again elect those who will represent them in government.Although some citizens aren\\'t even registered to vote-and some registered voters don\\'t bother to go to the polls-most Americans exercise their right to vote. They realize that their future is wrapped up in a special package-the ballot box. It\\'s a package that must definitely be \"handled with care\".\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n惊奇常常是在箱子里出现：包在彩色包装纸里面的生日礼物……朋友寄来牛皮纸包的包裹……不论是怎样的箱子，人们喜欢打开来看看里面是什么。在美国以及其他许多国家，有一个特殊的箱子关系着一个国家的未来，它被称为投票箱。人们在选举日投在箱子里的东西可以改变历史的走向。选举是民主的原动力。民主这个字照字面的意思是人民自主竹，是美国历史中一个重要的观念0 18世纪中期，英国开始通过一些使美国殖民地愤怒的法律。殖民地人民必须交付愈来愈多的税，而享有愈来愈少的自由。他们感到英国政府没有代表他们的权益1776年月4日，殖民地宣布从英国独立出去。他们想要建立民主制度，使人们在政府中有发言权。有效的民主制度定期举行选举。在美国，每两年选一次国会议员。在这些选举中，人们可以争取所有众议院的席位和1/3的参议院席位。除此以外，选民每4年要去投票选出国家的总统和副总统。选民也定期投票选出州长、市长及当地学校的董事会成员。有时，他们也必须投票决定提议的法律。在美国的选举制度中，人们并不直接投票给总统候选人，而是由选民给支持各个候选人的\"选举\"投票。每一州的选举人人数和代表此州的国会议员人数相同，等于每一州的两位参议员加上众议院的众议员人数（以各州的人口为基准）。在一个州里拥有最多票数的候选人就赢得了那一州所有选举人的票数。要赢得总统大选，候选人必须至少获得总共538个选举人中的270张票。多年来，美国在选举方面做了一些改革。早期有些改革禁止作弊、收受贿赂或威胁选民。他们也限制候选人从捐赠者那儿获得的金额数目及花在竞选宣传上的费用.1870年，黑人获得选举权0 1920年，选举权利延伸至妇女那里.近几十年来，通过了一些反对不公平选举规则的法律. 人们不再需要付特殊的税或通过测验才能选举。1971年，投票的年龄降至18岁。其他的改革减轻了盲人、残障者及文盲投票的困难。在某些地区，选票上面除了英文以外，还必须印上别的文字。1 1月5日，美国人要再一次选出在政府中代表他们的人，虽然有些市民甚至不是法定投票人——有些法定投票人懒得去投票—但是大多数的美国人都会行使他们投票的权利。他们了解他们的未来包在一个特别的箱子里——投票箱。它的确是一个必须“小心处理”的箱子。\\n====================\\nNO.34:\\nEnglish:\\nOne of the world\\'s most ancient and historically important trade routes, the Silk Road conjures up exotic images of camel caravans, windswept deserts and such legendary figures as Genghis Khan and Marco Polo. Extending from as far as the Indian kingdoms in the west to present day Xi\\'an in China in the east, the Silk Road had, by the third centry B.C.,already became a cross roads of Asia.Skirting the edges of the harsh and inhospitable Taklimakan desert, the Silk Road actually had several different branches, each passing through different oasis. All roads began in Chang\\'an (Xi\\'an). The northem route wound its way through places such as Turfan and Kuqa before finally ending at Kashgar. Them route followed the lower thnges of the Taklimakan eventually reaching the same destination. Numerous other routes were also plied through out the years, reaching all the way to\\nSamarkand, Tashkent, India, and the Caspian Sea.Silk was not the only commodity traveling the Silk Road. Other goods such as exotic animals, ivory and gold were also transported along the route. It was silk, though, which fascinated the Romans. Agents were sent from Rome to explore the route and to obtain the material at a lower price. The Romans, however, did not give the Silk Road its name. The term was actuallycoined by the 19th-centuryGerman scholar Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen.Not long after the Tang dynasty era (618-907), when trade along the Silk Road had reached its zenith, the fearsomeGenghis Khan and his Mongol armies conquered a vast area spanning much of Central Asia. Accordingly, the Silk Road became an important communication route between different parts of the Mongol Empire. During the ruleof Kublai,more Europeans began venturing towards China along the Silk Road.The most famous of these travelers was Marco Polo, whose thoughts and\\nadventures were later recorded and embellished by an Italian romance writer.During the 14th century , with the disintegration of the Mongol Empire, the isolationist policies of the Ming Dynasty and the development of the silk route by sea, the Silk Road was forced into decline. Renewed interest in it emerged among Westem scholars only near the end of the 19th century . The existence of ancient cities excited them, and an archaeological free-for-all began. These days, those seeking out treasures of the Silk Road can find them in such far-flung places as London, Delhi, and Berlin.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n世界上最古老、历史上最重要的贸易路线之一_丝绸之路，总给人．种富有异国情调的印象：骆驼商队、狂风肆虐的沙漠，还有诸如成吉思汗和马可波罗等传奇人物。丝绸之路绵亘远长，西至印度王国，东到中国现在的西安，早在公元前3世纪，丝绸之路就已经成为了亚洲交通的十字路口。丝绸之路其实有数条支线，它们分别沿着环境恶劣、不适合人类居住的塔克拉玛干沙漠外缘，穿越不同的绿洲。所有的路线都是始于长安（西安），北线蜿蜒经过了吐鲁番、库车，最后到达喀什格尔，南线沿着塔克拉玛干下缘前行，并到达同一终点。其他的许多支线也是历代都通行的，通往撒玛尔罕、塔什干、印度，及里海等地。丝绸并不是丝绸之路上运送的唯一商品。其他货物如奇珍异兽、象牙，及黄金等也通过丝绸之路运输。不过格外令罗马人着迷的还是丝绸。罗马派遣代理商探测这条路线，并以较低的价格购得丝绸。然而，“丝绸之路”的名称并不是罗马人起的。这个名称是19世纪时一名叫Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen的德国学者首创的。唐代是丝绸之路沿途贸易活动的鼎盛时期，在唐代王朝灭亡后不久，令人闻风丧胆的成吉思汗及其蒙古大军征服了横跨中亚大部分地区的广阔领土。丝绸之路于是成为蒙古帝国各部落间重要的交通线路。忽必烈统治期间，更多的欧洲人冒险沿着丝绸之路来到中国。这些旅行者中最出名的就是马可波罗，他的所见所闻后来被一位意大利传奇小 说家记载下来，并加以润色。14世纪时，蒙古帝国瓦解、明朝实行闭关政策，加“海上丝路”的发展，丝绸之路被迫走向没落。直到近19世纪末，才有西方学者重新燃起了对丝绸之路的兴趣。古城的存在让他们兴奋不已于是掀起了一阵考古热潮。现在，想在丝绸之路寻宝的人们，在伦敦、德里、柏林等许多地方，都可以找到他们想要的东西。\\n====================\\nNO.35:\\nEnglish:\\nNestled in the mountains of Bavaria, the fairy-tale castle of Neuschwanstein (New Swan Castle) stands as a king\\'s tribute to the chivalry and magic of a mythical age.The castle was the brainchild of Bavaria\\'s \"mad\" King Ludwig Inspired by Wagner\\'s operas, the young King Ludwig sought to recreate the legendary dreamworld of medieval knights and heroes.

Gladiators fought wild animals and one another to the death in retum for their continued survival, the glory of victory, and precious gifis from their benefactors.These spectacles of gratuitous violence may seem a little annchronistlic, but they are also analogues in many ways to professional sports today, Perhaps the Colosseum is not really such an \"ancient\" artifact after all.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n公元前80年由提特斯大帝宣布落成的罗马竞技场，可谓是超级穹顶的最早原型。罗马竞技场周长为527米，有80个入口 ，可容纳5～7万名观众，其规模及多用途的设计堪与最先进的体育馆相媲美，而其建筑之宏伟壮丽，则是后者所望尘莫及的。罗马竞技场是由数万吨名为“石灰华”的大理石加上300吨的钢铁铸建而成。完工后，其上面的4层有57米高。底下3层是观众席，被巨大的环状拱廊所环绕，还有80座完全对称的拱门，座座都刻有雕像。顶层部份有托架用以悬挂罩篷，可以遮荫。尽管设计得金碧辉煌，但建造罗马竞技场的主要目的是：在愤世嫉俗的时代中，供人们忘情娱乐，演出张力十足、不时令人毛骨悚然的娱乐节目。在以著名战役为背景的骇人节目中，成群奴隶为生存而战。战士们与猛兽搏斗或自相残杀，至死方休，换来的除了继续生存的权利、胜利的荣耀之外、还有赞助者馈赠的厚礼。这些暴力场面或许有些过时，然而类似的场景在现今职业运动中仍屡见不鲜。或许罗马竞技场并不是一座真正的“古迹”。\\n====================\\nNO.41:\\nEnglish:\\nOne of the lands of the midnight sun, Finland has much more to offer than the cold nights, saunas, and skiing it is often associated with. Visitors are enchanted by charming villages alongside sophisticated cities and the largest unspoiled wildemess in Europe.Finland is one of the most progressive countries in the world. For example, traffic fines are linked to gross income, an Intemet millionaire recently paid $70,000 for a speeding ticket. A reputation for eciency and organization has also made Finland host to many intemational meetings.This modern country maintains its traditions and hearty spirit,celebrating many festivals. Its most popular Midsummer\\'s Day finds many Finns lighting bonfires and drinking enthusiashcally at their country homes. Finland is also home to the world\\'s longest-nuuung rock festival, Ruisrock. The best-known event is the Savolinna Opera Festival, while the strangest is probably the annual wife-carrying championship, where the winner is awarded his wife\\'s weight in beer.Helsinki, Europe\\'s northemmost capital, boasts over 30 art galleries and museums. Although it is a cultural and economic center, it brings to mind small town charm with its many cafe and lack of tall buildings.While the city\\'s public transportation system is renowned, Helsinki\\'s extensive bicycle trails make riding around the city and its seaside parks a breeze.After seeing the Market Square and great architecmre, including the Church in the Rock, wliich was cut from solid stone, tourists may want to check out Helsinki\\'s bohemian art scene. Highbrow and popular culture meet at the Tennispalatsi with its museums and movie theaters. Lovers of modem art will also enjoy taking in the Lasapalatsi “ Glass Palace\" media center.A sight not to be missed is nearby Suomenlinna Island, where you can wander amid the ruins of an old sea fortress and visit several museums And only a few hours outside of Helsinki is Finland\\'s most notable historic building, Turku Castle, which was founded in 1280.While Finland is best enjoyed during the warmer months of May to September, its most famous resident is busiest in December. A little known fact is that Santa Claus does not live at the North Pole, but in the Lapland region of Finland. There, Santa receives about 600,000 letters a year written by children from over 150 countries.Besides dropping in on Santa, visitors to Lapland can enjoy trekking and skiing in Lemmenjoki Park with its dreamlike arctic landscape, dense forests, and free wildeness huts that dot the area. Tourists may also stay in glass igloos, from which they can see the midnight sun and the northem lights, and ride in dogsleds and reindeer sleighs.Lapland is home to the Samis, a native people who were gradually driven northward by development in Scandinavia. Their traditional livelihood revolves around reindeer, which number about 200,000 in Finland. Finally, don\\'t forget, but a great reindeer stew can be had in Lapland as well.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n芬兰，一个在午夜可以见到太阳的国家，除了常被人们想到的寒夜、桑拿浴与滑雪之外，它还有更多风格独特的面貌。优雅的城市周边的迷人村庄和欧洲占地最广、未遭人工破坏的荒野，往往令游客们陶醉不已。芬兰是全球最发达的国家之．。例如，其交通罚款的金额视个人总收入而定。最近一名网络巨子就因超速驾驶支付了7万美元的罚单。芬兰也因其高效率和很强的组织力的美誉而主办了许多国际会议。这个现代化的国家仍保留着其传统和蓬勃的朝气，并为许多节日举办庆祝活动。在芬兰最受欢迎的“施洗约翰节”这天，可以看见许多芬兰人在他们自己的乡间农合，点燃篝火，痛快畅饮一番。芬兰也是世界上历史最悠久的摇滚音乐节——“路易斯摇滚”——的主办地。节庆中最富盛名的，首推“沙弗力拿歌剧节”，而最匪夷所思的，则是一年一度的扛老婆大赛，大赛冠军可赢得和老婆雷量相当的啤酒。赫尔辛基，欧洲最北的首都，有30多座美术馆及博物馆。虽然它是芬兰的文化及经济中心，但因其为数众多的咖啡馆和罕见的高楼大厦，而让人感受到小镇般的迷人风情。尽管这里的公共运输远近驰名，但遍布赫尔辛基的自行车道，使在城市和海滨公园骑车驰骋，成为一件轻松惬意的事。参观过市场广场和用坚石砌成的“岩石教堂”等雄伟建筑后，游客们可能也想二探赫尔辛基自由奔放的艺术景观。其高雅与通俗文化交汇在坦尼斯宫的博物馆与电影院，而现代艺术的爱好者也会乐于一游拉撤官里“玻璃官竹的媒体中心。另一个丕容错过的景点是邻近的“苏欧门里那岛”，在那儿你可以徘徊流连于海洋要塞的古老遗迹塑参观多座博物馆。建于1280年的土尔库堡，离赫尔辛基仅数小时之遥，是芬兰最著名的史迹建筑。虽然芬兰在暖和的5～9月间气候景为宜人，二位最负盛名的芬兰居民则在12月最为忙碌。一个罕为人知的事实是圣诞老人并非住在北极，而是住在芬兰的拉普兰一带。在那里，圣诞老人每年会收到来自世界上1 50多个国家的孩子寄来的约60万封信。除了顺道拜访圣诞老人，前往拉普兰的游客也可以在拉门乔基公园享受徒步旅行与滑雪之乐，并欣赏它如梦似幻的北极圈风光、蓊郁的森林以及这片辽阔荒原上星罗棋布的小屋。游客们也可以呆在玻璃冰屋内观赏午夜的太阳和北极极光，或是乘坐狗或驯鹿拉的雪橇畅游一番。拉普兰是撒密斯人的故乡，这些土著居民由于斯堪的纳维亚半岛的开发而被迫逐渐向北迁徙。他们传统的生计是靠芬兰国内的大约20万只驯鹿。最后，别忘了，在拉普兰你还可以尝到很棒的炖驯鹿大餐呢。\\n====================\\nNO.42:\\nEnglish:\\nScotland is a unique and austere place, laden with history, where you can find aristocrafic palaces and castles, as well as the traditional parades in national costumes. It has some of the most beautiful cities in Europe, a living testimony of a proud and splendid past.In order to see and discover the true soul of Scotland today, what forged the character of this splendid region, we have to go towards the northern regions, to the Grampian Mountains. Beautiful and unspoiled,it was difficult to farm. The Scots subdued the environment with simple spades and strong arms,The history of this ancient struggle, and its people\\'s ancient love affair with the hard land, is enclosed within the walls of the Angus Folk Museum. You are able to get a feel ofthe t3rpical rural atmosphere of times past from the everyday artifacts displayed here,From coastal Aberdeen in towards the interior of the Grampian Mountains there runs the Castle Trail, a road that touches on many fortresses, which are witnesses of continual revolts against the dominion of neighboring England in Scottish history.Perhaps the most uplifting moment for Scottish autonomy is the experienced inside this ancient abbey ofArbroath, where, in 1320, the Declarahon oflndependence was celebrated, at the instigation of King Bruce. He carried out the plan for autonomy drawn up by the great popular hero William Wallace, to whom cmema has dedicated the wonderful film \"Braveheart\\', the winner offive Oscars.This is Glamis Castle. It is often remembered for being the residence of King Macbeth and Queen Elizabeth in her childhood. Among the most assiduous guests here are the inevitable ghosts, which are nourished,ifnot actually created, by ancient popular beliefs, These have been handed down over the centuries by a people inclined to live with mystery , with the forces ofthe supernatural。Another attraction here is a legendary monster: the Loch Ness Monster. Is it real or imaginary, this monster, which has been nicknamed Nessie, has collected a good 3000 sightings over the last 50 years? To fuel the debate about the monster, and perhaps also curiosity about the lake, a price of 500,000 pounds sterling has been put on Nessie\\'s head.The true flag of Scotland, tartan, is recognisable from the brightly coloured plaid pattems which are used to distinguish the various clans. Over the last few decades this fabric has made a comeback and is part of the daily life of this country.The trpical Scottish garment, the kilt, is de rigeur when the Scots play the Great Highland bagpipes, especially when they march in parades.Bagpipes and dancing open the competitions oflocal sporting events,which are called Highland Gatherings. The games, which have strange rules, involve a spirit that has more to do with brute force than with athletics.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n苏格兰是一个独特的地方，自然条件虽不算得天独厚，历史的厚重感却随处可见。豪门望族的府第与城堡历历在目，仪仗队的士兵也还穿着传统服装。这里有全欧洲最美的城市，它们诉说着苏格兰昔日的荣光。想看看真正的苏格兰，追寻这里民族精神的源泉，就得去北部的格兰扁山区。格兰扁山区景色怡人没有受到现代文明的污染，这里—度不适合耕作，而倔强的苏格兰人，凭着铁锹和双手征服了这片土地，苏格兰先民的艰苦劳作与他们自古对这片贫瘠土地的眷恋，在这个安格斯大众博物馆里一览无余。这里展出的都是平常的物品，营造出往日乡间的氛围，使人油然而生怀旧之情。从沿海的阿伯丁有一条古堡之路，它一直蜿蜒到格兰扃山区深处。沿途很多昔日的要塞，都是苏格兰在历史上不断反抗英格兰统治的见证。苏格兰争取自治的过程中最大快人心的时刻莫过于1320年在这个阿尔伯罗斯修道院里，布鲁斯国王鼓动百姓大肆庆贺独立宣言的签订。布鲁斯采纳传奇英雄威廉·华勒斯所献的计策，完成了自治大业，这个故事后来被改编成电影（（勇敢的心》，该片曾摘取了5项奥斯卡奖。苏格兰的另一大景点是格来米斯城堡，这座城堡之所以名闻遐迩，是因为曾经的两位主人——苏格兰国王麦克白与幼年时的伊丽莎白女王。(4)如今这里最殷勤的客人当数传说中挥之不去的幽灵，这些传说即使不是源于世代相传的民间故事，也大有受其启发之嫌疑。苏格兰人似乎生来就笃信超自然的力量，因此才有了这些传说。这里吸引游人的另一个原因则是尼斯湖的怪兽。真假姑且不论，这个呢称为Nessie的怪兽在过去的半个世纪中已经吸引了3000余名游客。如今它头上有50万英镑的悬赏，使得学术界的争论日益激烈，或许这也是为了增强游人的好奇心吧。苏格兰格子呢是苏格兰真正的旗帜。它显著的花格子图案曾经是区分不同宗族的标志。在过去几十年里，格子呢在苏格兰再度流行，如今则已在日常生活中不可或缺。苏格兰传统的褶裙按照礼节是应该在演奏高地风笛时穿的，尤其是在列队前进的时候。高地风笛与利尔舞揭开了高地运动盛会的序幕。运动会的比赛项目规则奇特，与其说是田径比赛，不如说是大力士的较量。\\n====================\\nNO.43:\\nEnglish:\\nAntarctica is the highest, driest, and coldest place on Earth. It is also the remotest, a fact which accounts for its unspoUed environment. It is difficultforpeople to get there, and not a comfortable place for people to stay once they arrive. It is widely described as the last true wilderness on our planet.The Antarctic continent has mountain ranges similar in size to the European Alps. But whereas the Alps\\' snowcaps are just deep enough for skiing, Antarctic mountains are swallowed up by their caps, and lie buried beneath an ice sheet that is five kilometers thick.The cold climate is responsible for maintaining the continent\\'s year round ice fields: They never melt. Even though Antarctica receives more sunlight than the equator, the temperatures are lower because the ice sheet reflects the heat back into space. Thus, the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica in July, 1983: Soviet scientists shivered through temperatures that fell to minus 89.2 degrees Celsius.For centuries, Europeans wondered about the existence of a South Polar continent, but no one actually knew for certain Antarctica was there until 1820 when European explorers \"discovered\" it. Since then, men have gone to Antarctica in search of adventure. Testing their abilities, several teams of explorers set out in 1911 to be the first men to stand at the South Pole. Norwegian Roald Amundsen and his men reached the pole; so did Robert F. Scott, an Englishman, but he and his team died on the return trip.Once completely inaccessible, Antarctica has more recently been playing host to adventurers seeking excitement, scientists interested in experimenting, and companies looking to exploit this wild terrain for profit.gold, uranium, and oil are just some of the valuable resources which lie beneath the continent\\'s icy covering.Though no human population is native to Antarctica, about l,000 people work there in the summer months, and another 12,000 tourists visit every year. They come to enjoy the unspoiled environment, the bright blue skies, and the fresh white snow fields.If a tourist is lucky enough, he or she can join an expedition to see some of the continent\\'s other residents. Animals along the coast of the Southem Ocean don\\'t mind the cold weather, and thrive in Antaraica\\'s seas. Penguins and seals breed on the icy shores and fish for krill in the cool water.Yet, Antarctica\\'s fragile and complicated ecosystem is threatened by its human visitors.Damage to the environment occurs as people come looking for resources beneath the ice, or carelessly leave their garbage behind. Currently, countries are working to ensure that the damage to Antarctica\\'s environment is minimized, and that the last wilderness on Earth will remain an unspoiled place.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n南极洲是地球上最高、最千和最冷的地方。它也是最偏僻的，这就解释了南极洲为什么会成为一片没被污染的环境。人们很难到达那儿，即使到了那里，南极洲也不是个能让人呆得舒适的地方。它被普遍形容为我们星球上的最后一片真正的荒野。南极大陆的山脉覆盖的面积与欧洲的阿尔卑斯山差不多。不过阿尔卑斯山顶积雪的深度仅够滑雪，南极大陆的山脉却被积雪吞噬，深埋在厚达5公里的冰层下。寒冷的气候使南极冰厚得可以常年维持：它们永不融化。虽然南极洲的光照比赤道多，气温却比它低，因为冰层能将热能反射回天空。因此，地球上的最低温度记录就是出现在1983年7月的南极洲,前苏联科学家在降至摄氏零下89.2度的低温中瑟瑟发抖。几个世纪以来，欧洲人_直在猜测是否存在南极洲，直到1820年欧洲的探险家“发现”了它，人们才真正确定南极洲的存在。从那以后，人们开始去南极洲探险。1911年，几支探险队为了验证自己的能力便出发去南极洲，希望能成为站在南极极点的先锋。挪威人罗德·阿蒙森和队友抵达了极点。英国人罗伯特。F．斯科特也做到了\\'不过他和他的队友却在回程中不幸丧生。曾经遥不可及的南极洲，近来却开始接待寻求刺激的冒险家、有兴趣做实验的科学家和打算开发这片荒原获利的公司。黄金、铀和石油只不过是埋藏在南极冰层下宝贵资源中的几种而已。虽然南极洲没有土著居民，但每年夏季的几个月里，约有1000人在那儿工作，另外每年还有约12000名游客来此参观。他们到南极来享受没有污染的环境、碧蓝的天空和皓洁的雪原。如果游客够幸运的话，他（她）还可以加入探险队一睹南极大陆上的其他生物。南太平洋沿岸的动物不介意严寒的气候，它们在南极海域中繁衍生息。企鹅和海豹则在结冰的海岸上繁衍后代，并在冰冷的海水中捕捉磷虾。不过，南极洲脆弱而复杂的生态系统正受到游客的威胁。人们来这儿寻找冰层下的自然资源，或不经意的留下垃圾，都会对环境造成污染。目前，各国正努力将对南极洲环境的破坏降到最低，以确保地球上的最后—片荒野能永远是一块未受破坏的地方。\\n====================\\nNO.44:\\nEnglish:\\nVenna Named Citywith World\\'s Best Quality of LivingVienna has beaten Zurich to be crowned the place with the best quality of living in an annual survey in which European cities dominated the top 10.Management consultancy Mercer said Vienna scored the highest for overall quality of living in the 215-city survey after improvements in Austria\\'s political and social environment, knocking the Swiss city of Zurich into second position。Third in the list came another Swiss city, Geneva, followed by Vancouver, Canada, and Auckland, New Zealand, in shared fourth place.

You will say with the French, \"A bientot, Paris, a bientot!\" (See you again soon, Paris!)\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n啊，美丽的巴黎！几个世纪以来，这个城市赢得了整个世界的崇拜。巴黎的诱惑与魅力吸引了所有到此游玩的人。你在哪里可以找到巴黎对你的吸引力呢？是否是在历任的法国统治者们在美化他们所钟爱的城市时所留下来的遗产里？还是在那些有名的城堡、皇宫、雕像和纪念碑里呢？你能否在世界一流的博物馆，例如卢浮宫中找着呢？或许巴黎的诱惑力在于巴黎人的特殊品味和风格。当你到巴黎游玩时，别把时间全都花在看博物馆和纪念碑上面。它们当然很值得你花时间去参观，但今天先忘掉它们。首先来四处看看，并体验—下巴黎的生活。你会在其中发现它的迷人之处的。沿着塞纳河漫步吧。浏览艺术家们丰富色彩的绘画，透过那些精致的铁门，向内偷窥那些精心照看的花园。仔细留心法国人对于细节的留意，这使得法国成为“好品味”的同义词。你可以在门廊或拱门以及小喷泉和古怪有趣的走廊的设计上发现这一点。不管你往哪里看，你都会觉得日常物品已经变成了艺术品。花些时间，在一个安静的公园里面的旧板凳上轻松地休息或是躺在青草地上。想吃点心的时候，尝尝路边咖啡店的咖啡及点心。你也可以找一个巴黎人展开一段会话，但这也不太容易，有这么大的国际人口居住在此地，要找到一个真正当地的巴黎人是很难的。到了傍晚时分，随着码头上雾气的升起，巴黎的诱惑力也随之而起。你也会听到附近室外音乐会所演奏的乐曲，其中包括古典乐、爵士乐、歌剧或是香颂即法国的民歌。巴黎人热爱自己的音乐，繁星点缀的天空，就是他们演奏的大礼堂。你也可以在城堡或教堂里聆听音乐会。在巴黎，音乐是不会停止的。不要错过了巴黎的夜生活中最重要的一部分：下馆子。巴黎人对其烹饪非常骄傲，他们理当如此，因为它世界驰名。美食本来就是与生活享乐不可分割的。为了帮你从几百家绝佳的餐厅中作选择，你需要—本特别的指南。法国的首都以各地的特色风味、乳酪和酒著称于世，如果你不知道要点什么，可以要“推荐菜单”来看。大厨喜欢在此将他最拿手的菜作一番橱窗展示。请记住，在你尚未在巴黎的法国餐厅里吃过饭之前，都不算尝过法国真正的风味。在你的美食晚餐之后，可以到被聚光灯照耀的纪念碑去走一趟。穿过(Pont Neuf)这个城市中最古老的桥——第九桥，你将到达城市之岛(Ile de la Cite)，此时巴黎最有名的标志——圣母院会隐约地呈现在你的面前。站在教堂前面的广场，此时你也正处于法国的正中心，因为所有的距离皆是以圣母院前门开始计算，法国的每一条路都通往它的前门。所有的法国国王或统治者都曾经旅游到此来纪念重要的节日或感恩。圣母院是巴黎的中心，也是法国的中心。你的巴黎之旅才刚刚开始呢。你才刚刚开始发现这个古老城市的魅力。希望你剩余的旅程将令你难以忘怀。当你该起程回家时，你会依依不合。然后用法文说道：后会有期，巴黎！\\n====================\\nNO.48:\\nEnglish:\\nScientists unveiled on Sunday the first direct evidence that massive floods deep below Antarctica\\'s ice cover are accelerating the flow of glaciers into the sea.How quickly these huge bodies of ice slide off the Antarctic and Greenland land masses into the ocean help determine the speed at which sea levels rise.The stakes are enormous: An increase measured in tens of centimeters could wreak bavoc for hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas and island nations around the world.Researchers discovered only recently that inaccessible subglacial lakes in Antarctica periodically shed huge quantities of water.Data collected by a satellite launched in 2003-the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, or ICESat-revealed a complex network of subglacial plumbing in which water periodically cascades from one hidden reservoir to another.But the new study, published online in the joumal Nature Geoscience, is the first to measure the potential impact ofthis invisible fiooding on sea bound glaciers.A trio of scientists led by Steams of the Climate Change Insttute at the University of Maine matched ICESat data against a nearly 50-year record of how fast the Byrd Glacier in East Antarctica has moved toward the sea.They discovered that during the same 14-month period that l.7 cubic km of water cascaded through subglacial waterways, the 75-km long glacier downstream pick up speed, moving about 10 percent faster.\"Our findings provide direct evidence that an active lake drainage system can cause large and rapid changes in glacier dynamics,\" the researchers concluded.\"Water acts as a lubricant, reducing friction at the base of the ice and making ice flow faster,\" explained Helen Fricker of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of California in a commentary, also in Nature Geoscience.The study adds to growing scientific concern about the pace at which glaciers are melting into the seas.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n科学家于上周日首次公布资料，证明南极冰层下的大规模水流正加速冰川流向海洋。这些体积庞大的冰川正从南极大陆和格陵兰岛漂向海洋，它们漂移的速度直接决定了海平面升高的速度。这导致的后果将触目惊心：海平面升高几十厘米就足以威胁居住在地势较低的三角洲及岛国地区的亿万人民的生存。研究人员最近发现，南极冰层下隐秘的湖泊会发生周期性的倾泻。美国宇航局2003年发射的“冰云和地面高度卫星”(ICESat)收集的数据显示，南极冰层下有一个复杂的湖泊排水网络，湖水会周期性地从一个隐秘的湖泊流向另一个湖泊。而这项最新研究则首次估量了海洋冰川下隐秘水流的潜在影响，该研究成果在<自然地学》期刊的网络版上发表。以美国缅因州大学气候变化学院的斯特恩斯为首的3位科学家将卫星数据与南极东部的伯德冰川在过去近50年中移向海洋的速度进行了对比。通过比较，研究人员发现，在14个月的时间中，冰层下的湖泊溢出了1.7立方千米的水，75公里长的伯德冰川的移动速度加快了10%。研究人员由此得出结论：“活跃的湖泊排水系统会导致冰川运动出现大规模、快速的变化，我们的研究结果为此提供了直接的证据。”加州斯克里普斯海洋学研究所的海伦·弗里克在一篇科学评论中解释说：“水可以起到润滑剂的作用，减少了冰层底部的摩擦，所以加速了冰川的流动。”她的这篇文章也在《自然地学》期刊上发表。该研究进一步加剧了科学家对冰川融化速度的担忧。\\n====================\\nNO.49:\\nEnglish:\\nThere was a rich merchant who had 4 wives. He loved the 4th wife the most and adorned her with rich robes and treated her to delicacies. He took great care ofher and gave her nothing but the best. He also loved the 3rd wife very much. He\\'s very proud of her and always wanted toshow off her to his friends.However, the merchant is always in great fear that she might run away with some other men. He too, loved his 2nd wife. She is a ver3r considerate person, always patient and in fact is the merchant\\'s confidante. Whenever the merchant faced some problems, he always turnedto his 2nd wife and she would always help him out and tide him through dimcult times. Now, the merchant\\'s lst wife is a very loyal partner and has made great contributions in maintaining liis wealth and business as well as taking care of the household. However, the merchant did not love the first wife and although she loved him deeply, he hardly took notice of her. One day, the merchant fell ill. Before long, he knew that he was going to die soon. He thought ofhis luxurious life and told himself, \"Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, I\\'ll be alone. How lonely I\\'ll be!\" Thus, he asked the 4th wife, \"I loved you most, and owed you with the finestclothingand showered great care over you.Now that I\\'m dying, will you follow me and keep me company?\" \"No way!\" replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another word. The answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchant\\'s heart. The sad merchant then asked the 3rd wife, \\'I have loved you so much for all my life. Now that I\\'m dying, will you follow me and keep me company?\" \"No!\" replied the 3rd wife. \"Life is so good over here! I\\'m going to remarry when you die!\" The merchant\\'s heart sank and turnedcold. He then asked the 2nd wife, “I always tumed to you for help and you\\'ve always helped me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?\" \"I\\'m sorry,\\'I can\\'t help you out this time!\" replied the 2nd wife. \"At the very most, I can only send you to your grave.\" The answer came like a bolt ofthunder and the merchant was devastated. Then a voice called out: I leave with you. I\\'ll follow you no matter where you go.\" The merchant looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrihon. Greatly grieved, the merchant said, \"I should haye taken much better care of you while I could have!\"Actually, we all have 4 wives in our lives. The 4th wife is our body.No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good,it\\'ll leave us when we die. Our 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they aU go to others. The 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us when we\\'re alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave. The lst wife is in fact our soul,neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and sensual pleasure. Guess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it\\'s a good idea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we\\'re on our deathbed to lament.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n从前，一位富有的商人娶了4个老婆。他最爱他的小老婆，并给她华丽的衣裳和美味佳肴。他对她体贴人微，把最好的东西都给了她。商人也很爱第3个老婆。他为她感到骄傲，并常把她作为在朋友面前炫耀的资本。但他同时也忧心忡忡，怕她与其他男人跑掉了。当然，商人也爱第2个老婆，她既善解人意又有耐心。事实上，她是商人的红颜知己。每每遇到困难，他就会找她，而她也总能帮助他走出困境、渡过难关。至于大老婆，她是一位忠诚的伴侣，替他照料生意、打理家务，忙里忙外，可谓劳苦功高。然而，尽管她爱得这么深，商人却偏不钟情于她，甚至没把她放在心上。一日，商人得了重病，他自知将不久人世。他回顾了自己奢华的一生，不禁心中怅然：“现在我虽然有4个老婆相伴，但死后却要孤零零—人。多寂寞啊！”于是，他问小老婆：“我最疼你，给你买最漂亮的衣服，还对你呵护备至.现在我就要离开这个世界了，你愿意随我而去，与我相伴吗？”“绝不可能！\"她丢下一句话，径自走开了。小老婆的回答如一把尖刀插在商人心上。伤心的商人继而问第3个老婆：“我—直对你宠爱有加。如今，我将不久于人世，你愿意随我而去，与我相伴吗？”“不！”她拒绝道，人间的生活多么美好啊！你死后我会改嫁他人！”商人的心倏地下沉，渐渐变冷。他再转向第2个老婆，问道：“我过去常常求助于你，你也总能为我排忧解难。现在我想再请你帮一次忙。我死后，你愿意随我而去，与我相伴吗？竹“很抱歉，这一次我帮不了你，”她说，“我最多只能让你人士为安。”这句话犹如晴天霹雳，商人彻底绝望了．这时，旁边传来一个声音：“我愿意随你．同离去。无论你到哪里，我都会跟着你。”商人抬起头，看到了自己的大老婆。她是那么消瘦，一副营养不良的样子。商人悲痛万分，他说：“我过去就应该好好地珍惜你啊！”其实，我们每个人的一生都有4位爱人相伴。小老婆代表我们的躯体。无论我们花费多少的时间和精力想去装扮她，我们死后它终会弃我们而去。第3位老婆代表财产、地位与金钱。一旦我们撒手西去，它终究会转向他人。第2个老婆则代表了我们的家人与朋友。我们活着的时候，无论他们与我们多么亲近，他们最多也只能到墓前送我们最后一程。至于大老婆，她则是我们的灵魂。当我们沉迷于追求物质、金钱或感官享受的时候，她常常会被遗忘在一旁。结果呢？她才是唯一与我们永远相伴的。也许从现在开始，我们就应该悉心照顾好她，而不是等到临终之际才悔恨不已。\\n====================\\nNO.50:\\nEnglish:\\nWe lived on the banks of the Tennessee River, and we owned the summers when we were girls. We ran wild through humid srumner days that never ended but only melted one into the other. We floated down rivers of weekdays with no school, no rules, no parents, and no constructs other than our fantasies. We were good girls, my sister and We had nothing to rebel against. This was just life as we knew it, and we knew the summers to be long and to be ours.The road that ran past our house was a one-lane rural route. Every monung, after our parents had gone to work, I\\'d wait for the mail lady to pull up to our box. Some days I would put enough change for a few stamps into a mason jar lid and I eave it in the mailbox. I hated bothering mail lady with this transaction, which made her job take longer. But I liked that she knew that someone in our house sent letters into the outside world.I liked walking to the mailbox in my bare feet and leaving footprints on the dewy grass. I imagined that feeling the wetness on the bottom of my feet made me a poet. I had never read poetry, outside of some Emily Dickinson. But I imagined that people who knew of such things would walk to their mailboxes through the moming dew in their bare feet.We planned our weddings with the help of Barbie dolls and the tiny purple wildflowers growing in our side yard. We became scientists and tested concochons of milk, orange juice, and mouthwash. We ate handfuls of bittersweet chocolate chips and licked peanut butter off spoons. When we ran out of sweets to eat, we snitched sugary Flintstones vitamins out of the medicine cabinet. We became masters of the Kraftt macaroni and checse lunch, and we dutifully called our mother at work three times a day to give her updates on our adventures. But don\\'t call too often or speak too loudly or whine too much, we told ourselves, or else they\\'ll get annoyed and she\\'ll get fired and the summers will end.We shaped our days the way we chose, far from the prying eyes of adults. We found our dad\\'s Playboys and charged the neighborhood boys money to look at them. We made crank calls around the county, telling people they had won a new car. \"What kind?\" they\\'d ask. \"Red,\" we\\'d always say. We put on our mom\\'s old prom dresses, complete with gloves and hats, and sang backup to the C.W. McCall song convoy, which we\\'d found on our dad\\'s turntable.We went on hikes into the woods behind our house, crawling under barbed wire fences and through tangled undergrowth. Heat and humidity found their way through the leaves to our flushed faces. We waded in streams that we were always surprised to come across. We walked past cars and auto parts that had been abandoned in the woods, far from any road. We\\'d reach the tree line and come out unexpectedly into a cow pasture. We\\'d perch on the gate or stretch out on the large flat limestone out crop that marked the end of the Woods Behind Our House. One day a thunderstorm blew up along the Tennessee River. It was one of those storms that make the day go dark and the humidity disappear. First it was still and quiet. There was electricity in the air and then the sharp crispness of a summer day being blown wide open as the winds rushed in. We threw open all the doors and windows. We found the classical radio station from two towns away and tumed up the bass and cranked up the speakers. We let the wind blow in and churn our summer day around. We let the music we were only vaguely familiar with roar through the house. And we twirled. We twirled in the living room, in the wind and in the music. We twirled and we imagined that we were poets and dancers and scientists and spring brides.We twirled and imagined that if we could let everything the thunder, the storm, the wind , the world-into that house in the banks of the Tennessee River, we could live in our summer dreams forever. When we were girls.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n在我们还是小女孩的时候，夏天是我们的，那时，我们家住在田纳西河畔。在那些永无尽头、一天天彼此交融的湿润夏日里，我们撒了野地跑着。我们在长长的日子中放任着自己，没有学校的管束、没有规则的羁绊、没有父母的训诫、没有既定的观念，只有属于我们自己的梦幻。我和姐姐，我们都是好女孩，那些日子里没有什么需要我们去对抗和反叛的。这就是我们所知的生活，我们知道夏日正长，而且是属于我们的。我家门前的那条路是一条单车道的乡间小路。每天早上父母上班以后，我会等着女邮差把车停在我们的信箱跟前。有时候，我会在大口玻璃瓶的瓶盖里放上够买几张邮票的零钱，再把它放在信箱里面。我讨厌为这样的交易去麻烦女邮差，这会延长她的工作时间。但我喜欢让她知道我们家里也有人寄信到外面的世界。我喜欢赤足走向我家的信箱，在沾着露水的草地上留下脚印。我想像着，足底湿漉漉的感觉使我成了一个诗人。除了艾米莉·狄金森的一些作品外，我其实从不读诗。但是我想，懂得这类东西的人_定会赤足踏着晨露走向他们的信箱。我们用芭比娃娃和旁边小花园里紫色的小野花来筹办我们的婚礼游戏。我们是尝试将牛奶、橙汁和漱口水混合在一起的科学家。我们吃光一把又一把甜中带苦的巧克力片，并把勺子上的花生酱舔得干干净净。糖果吃完了，我们就从药箱里偷拿有甜味的弗林斯通复合维生素。我们成了用卡夫通心面和干酪烹制午餐的专家，并尽职尽责地每天给正在上班的妈妈打3个电话汇报我们的最新情况。但是，我们告诫自己：不要打太多电话，不要说得太大声，也不要在电话里过多地诉苦，要不然他们就会生气，妈妈就会被解雇，美好的夏日也就完结了。远离大人们窥视的目光，我们按自己选择的方式安排着生活。我们找出了爸爸的（（花花公子）》杂志，让邻家的男孩们付费观看。我们给全县各地的人打神秘电话，对他们说他们赢得了一辆新车。“什么样的？”他们会问。而我们总是回答：“红的。”我们穿上妈妈在班级舞会上穿的旧礼服，配上手套和帽子，并伴唱着在爸爸的唱机上找到的麦考尔的《护卫队》这首歌。我们到屋后的树林里远足，从带刺的铁丝篱墙下爬过，穿过缠绕纠结的灌木丛。热气和湿气透过树叶的罅隙扑上我们绯红的脸颊。每次我们总是会意外地遇到溪流，于是我们就在其中涉水而行。我们走过被丢弃在远离大路的林中的轿车和汽车部件。我们会—直走到树林边上，结果意外地走进一个奶牛场。我们会倚坐在门上休息，或者摊开四肢躺在露出地面的又大又平的石灰岩上。这些岩石标志着“屋后树林”的尽头。有一天，田纳西河沿岸出现了暴风雨。这样的暴风雨让天空变得阴沉起来，同时也驱走了湿气。刚开始，一切宁静又安详。一会儿功夫， 空气中孕含着电流，乍起的风把夏日的清爽吹得豁然大开。我们敞开所有的门窗，把收音机调到两个镇子之外的古典音乐台，加重低音并把音量开得大大的。我们让风吹进来，让它肆意搅动着我们的夏日。我们让似曾相熟的音乐在屋子里轰鸣，我们则在一边随着音乐飞快地旋转。在客厅中、在风中、在音乐里，我们飞旋着，想象自己是诗人、是舞者、是科学家、是春天里的新娘。我们飞旋着，想象要是能让一切——雷声、暴风雨、狂风以至整个世界——旋人田纳西河畔的那座房子，我们就能永远活在我们的夏日之梦里。那时，我们还是小女孩。\\n====================\\nNO.51:\\nEnglish:\\nWhen he told me he was leaving I felt like a vase which has just smashed. There were pieces of me all over the tidy, tan tiles. He kept talking, telling me why he was leaving, explaining it was for the best, I could do better, it was his fault and not mine. I had heard it before many times and yet somehow was still not immune; perhaps one did not become immune to such blow.He left and I tried to get on with my life, I filled the kettle and put it on to boil, I took out my old red mug and filled it with coffee watching as each coffee granule slipped in to the mug. That was what my life had been like, endless omissions of coffee granules, somehow never managing to make that cup of coffee.Somehow when the kettle piped its finishing waming I pretended not to hear it. That\\'s what Mike\\'s leaving had been like, sudden and with an awful finality. I would rather just wallow in uncertainty than have things finished.I laughed at myself. Imagine geffing all philosophical and sentimental about a mug of coffee. I must be getting old.And yet it was a young woman who stared back at me from the mirror. A young woman full of promise and hope, a young woman with bright eyes and full lips just waiting to take on the world. I never loved Mike anyway. Besides there are more important things. More important than love, I insist to myselffirmly. The lid goes back on the coffee just like closure on the whole Mike experience.He doesn\\'t haunt my dreams as I feared that night. Instead I am flying far across fields and woods, looking down on those below me.Suddenly I fall to the ground and it is only when I wake up that I realize I was shot by a hunter, brought down by the burden of not the bullet but the soul of the man who shot it. I realize later, with some degree of understanding, that Mike was the hunter holding me down and I am the bird that longs to fly. The next rught my dream is similar to the previous\\nnights, but without the hunter.I fly free until I meet another bird who flies with me in perfect harmony. I realize with some relief that there is a bird out there for me, there is another person, not necessarily a lover perhaps just a friend, but there is someone out there who is my soul mate. I think about being a broken vase again and realize that I have glued myself back together, what Mike has is merely a little part of my time in earth, a little understanding of my physicalbeing. He has only, a little piece ofme.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n当他告诉我他要离开的时候，我感觉自己就像花瓶裂成了碎片，跌落在干净的茶色瓷砖地板上。他_直在说话，解释着为什么要离开，说什么这是最好的选择，我可以做得更好，都是他的错，与我无关。虽然这些话我已经听上好几千遍了，可每次听完都让我很受伤，或许在这样巨大的打击面前没有人能做到无动于衷。他走了，我尝试着继续过自己的生活。我把水壶装满水烧上，取出我那只红色的旧马克杯，倒入咖啡，看着咖啡粉末一点点地落A杯子里。这正是我现在生活的鲜活写照，不断地往下掉咖啡粉末，却从来没有真正地泡成一杯咖啡。水开了，水壶发出警报声，我假装没有听见。迈克的离去也是一样，突如其来，并且无可挽回。要知道，我宁愿忍受分与不分的煎熬，也不愿意以这样的方式被宣判“死刑”。想着想着我就哑然失笑，自己竟然为一杯咖啡有如此多的人生感怀，我自己一定是老了。可镜子里回瞪着我的那个女孩还是那么年轻啊！她明目皓齿，充满了前途与希望，光明的未来在向她招手。没关系的，反正我也从来没有爱过迈克。何况，生命中还有比爱更重要的东西在等待着我，我对自己坚持说。我将咖啡罐的盖子盖好，也将所有关于迈克的记忆尘封起来。那天晚上，出乎意料的是，他并没有进入到我的梦中。在梦里，我飞过田野和森林，俯瞰着大地。突然间，我掉了下来……醒来后才发现原来自己被猎人打中了，但是令我坠落的不是他的子弹，而是他的灵魂。我后来才渐渐明白，原来迈克就是那个使我坠落的猎人，而我是那只渴望飞翔的小鸟。到了第二天晚上，我仍然做了类似的梦，但是猎人不见了，我—直在自由地飞翔，直到遇上另外一只小鸟和我比翼双飞。我开始意识到，总有那么一只鸟，那么一个人在前面等我，这个人可能是我的爱人，可能只是朋友，但一定是知我懂我的人，这令我感觉如释重负。我想起自己曾经觉得像花瓶一样裂开了，这才意识到原来自己已经把自己修理好了.迈克只是我生命过程中的小小过客，他仅仅了解我的表面而已，他仅仅是我生命中小小的一部分。\\n====================\\nNO.52:\\nEnglish:\\nTwo men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room.One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the ftuid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room\\'s only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back.The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military anda whole lot of things. Every afternoon, when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window.The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color ofthe world outside.The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance.As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.One warm aftemoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn\\'t hear the band he could see it in his mind\\'s eye as the gentleman by the window pojrtrayed it with descriptive words.Days and weeks passed. one morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for theirbaths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away.As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly tum to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a blank wall.The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate to have described such wonderful things outside this window.The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see thewall. She said, \"Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.\"\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n两个病重的男人住在同一间病房。其中一个每天下午需要在床上坐起来一个小时，以便排出肺部的流质食物。他的床靠着这间房子的唯一一扇窗户。另一个人则只能平躺在床上度日。他们能连续说上好几个小时的话。他们谈论各自的妻子和家人、他们的家、他们的工作、他们参军的经历，还有好多其他的事情。每天下午，当靠着窗户的那个人能坐起来的时候，他总是向他的室友描绘他看到的窗外发生的所有事情。睡在另一张床上的人开始盼望着那些—小时的生活。每当那时，他的生活就会因窗外的一切活动和多姿多彩而感到开阔和愉快。从窗口望去是一个公园，里面有一个可爱的池塘。鸭子和天鹅在水中嬉戏，孩子们则在划模型船，年轻的恋人手挽手在绚丽多彩的花丛中散步，远处是城市地平线上美丽的风景。靠窗的这个人用优美的语言详细描绘这些的时候，房子另一端的那个人就会闭上眼睛想象那些栩栩如生的情景。一个温和的下午，窗口的那个人描绘了经过此处的阅兵。尽管另一个人听不到乐队演奏，但他却能看到。当窗口那个人用生动的语言描绘的时候，他则用心在看。一天天过去了’一周周过去了。一天早晨，当值白班的护士为他们提来洗澡水，看到的却是窗口那个男人的尸体，他已经在睡梦中安然去世了.她很悲伤，便叫医院的值班人员把尸体抬走了。一到合适的时机，另一个人便问他能否搬到窗口那儿去。护士很乐意为他作了调换，在确信他觉得舒适后，就离开了。缓慢地痛苦地，他用一个胳膊肘支撑着自己起来，想第一次亲眼看看外面的真实世界。他竭尽全力慢慢地朝床边的窗口望去看到的却只是一面墙。这个人问护士是什么促使他过世的室友描绘出窗外那么丰富的世界的。护士回答说，那个人是个盲人，甚至连墙都看不见。她说：“也许他只是想鼓励你。”\\n====================\\nNO.53:\\nEnglish:\\nHe was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from dock at his family\\'s cabin on an island in the middle ofa Nes Hanpshire lake.On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake.When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully worked the fish alongside the dock.Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass.The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish, gills playing back and forth in the moonlight. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M-two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy.\"You\\'ll have to put it back, son,\" he said.\"Dad!\" cried the boy.\"There willbe other fish,\" said his father.\"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy.He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father.Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could tell by the clarity of his father\\'s voice that the decision was not negotiable. He slowly worked the hook out of the lip ofthe huge bass and lowered it into the black water.The creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish.That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father\\'s cabin is still there on the island in the middle ofthe lake. He takes his own son and daughter fishing from the same dock.And he was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one be landed that rught long ago. But he does see that same fish again and again-every time he comes up against a question ofethic.For, as his father taught him, ethic is simple matter of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethic that is difficult. Do we do right when no one is looking? Do we refuse to cut corners to get the design in on time?

Although I never knew it then, I just held on to something that would never come to pass. Dreams really do exist. But in the morning when you wake up, they are remembered just as a dream. That is what happened to me.I always had the dream to dance like a beautiful ballerina twirling around and around and hearing people applaud for me. When I was young,I would twirl around and around in the fields of wildflowers that grew in my backyard.I thought that if I twirled faster everything would disappear and I would wake up in a new place. Reality woke me up when I heard a voice saying, \"I don\\'t know why you bother trying to dance. Ballerinas are pretty , slender little girls. Besides, you don\\'t have the talent to even be a ballerina.\" I remember how those words paralyzed every feeling in my body. I fell to the ground and wept for hours.We lived in the country by a nearby lake. I did not like to be at home.When my parents were home, my mother just yelled and criticized because nothing was ever perfect in her life. She dreamed of a different life but she ended up living in the country far away from the city where she believed her dreams would have come true.I enjoyed hanging out by the water. I would sit there for hours and stare at my reflection. There I was, looking nothing like a pretty ballerina dancer. Reflections don\\'t lie. Once the waves would come, my reflection was gone. Washed away just like my dream to dance.As I grew older, I began to realize that the reason my dream was even born, was because it was something that was. inside of me. The dream I had was never nurtured and cared for, so it slowly died. It\\'s not that I wanted it to die, but I allowed it to die the day I started listening to the words, \"You can\\'t do it.\" When I finally woke up from many years of dreaming, I realized that you can\\'t settle for dancing in the wildflowers, you have to move on to the platform。\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n我一出生，梦想就结束了，然而当时我却毫不知晓，仍执著于一些永无实现之日的事情。我的确怀有许多梦想。不过，当早晨醒来之时，所记起的却只是一场梦境而已。我的经历就是如此。我一直梦想着像一个美丽的芭蕾演员一样跳舞，轻盈地旋来转去，耳边是人们的掌声喝彩。小时候，我常常在自家后院长满野花的草地上练习芭蕾舞的旋转动作。我想要是我转得再快一点，眼前的一切都会消失，我将会获得一方新的天地。然而现实唤醒了我，我听到一个声音说：“我不明白你为什么不厌其烦地尝试跳舞。跳芭蕾舞的人都长得漂亮、苗条、娇小可爱。还有，你也没有跳芭蕾舞的天分。”记得当时那些话让我的全身都失去了知觉。我瘫倒在地上，哭了好几个小时。我们家住在乡下，附近有一个湖。我不喜欢待在家里，妈妈总是在家里大喊大叫着抱怨生活处处不如意。 她曾经梦想着能够住在城市里，只有在那里她的理想才能实现，而后来却住在这远离城市的乡下，这与她的理想大相径庭。我喜欢到水边待着，在那儿，我常常一坐就是几个小时，静静地望着水中我的倒影。水中的我哪也不像一个漂亮的芭蕾舞演员，倒影从不撒谎。微波荡过，倒影消失了\\'就像我跳舞的梦想一样消失了。随着我的成长我开始明白之所以我的梦想会产生，是因为它就在我心里。而我从未培育和呵护过它，因此它慢慢地死去了。我并不想让它死去，但是从我听到“你办不到”这种话的那一天，我就放任了它的离去。最后，当我从多年来的梦想中醒来时，我才明白过来 你不能满足于在野花丛中跳舞，你必须设法到舞台上去跳。\\n====================\\nNO.55:\\nEnglish:\\nInside the Russian Embassy in London a KGB colonel pufTed a cigarette as he read the handwritten note for the third time. There was no need for the writer to express regret, he thought. Correcting this problem would be easy. He would do that in a moment. The thought of it caused a grim smile to appear and joy to his heart. But he pushed away those thoughts and tumed his attention to a framed photograph on his desk. His wife was beautiful, he told himself as he remembered the day they were\\nmarried. That was forty-three years ago, and it had been the proudest and happiest day ofhis life,What had happened to all that time? Why had it passed so quickly, and why hadn\\'t he spent more ofit with her? Why hadn\\'t he held her close and told her more often that he loved her?He cursed himself as a tear came from the comer ofhis eye, ran down his cheek, and then dropped onto the note. He stitTened and wiped his face with the back of his hand. There was no need for remorse or regret, he told himself. In a few moments he would join her and at that time would express his undying love and\\ndevotion.After setting the note ablaze he dropped it into an ashtray and watched it burn. For a time the blaze cast moving shadows on the walls of the darkened room, then they nickered and died out. The colonel dropped the cigarette to the floor and ground it out with his heel, then clutched the photograph to his breast, removed a pistol from his pocket, placed the barrel in his mouth and pulled the trier. In the ashtray a small portion of the note remained. Where it had been wetted by his tear it had failed to bum, and on that scrap of paper were the words \"died yesterday\".\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n在伦敦的俄国使馆，一位克格勃上校一边抽着烟，一边读着一张手写的字条，这已是他第3次在读这张字条了口便条的作者不必表示遗憾了，上校这样想着。纠正这个错误其实很容易。他只要一会儿工夫便会做到。想到这里，他的脸上不禁浮现出一种可怕 的笑容，内心深处充满了快乐之情。上校从沉思中游离出来，将注意力集中到桌子上的一个像框上，他的妻子是位美丽的女人，当想起他们成婚的那一天时他不禁自语道。那已是43年前的事情了\\'可却是他一生中最自豪最幸福的日子。那些时候都发生了什么？为什么时光流逝得如此之快？为什么他没能将更多的时光用来陪伴她？为什么他没能将她搂紧，更多次地告诉她他爱她？ 他于是开始诅咒起自己，泪水也忍不住夺眶而出，流过面颊，最后滴落在字条上。这时，他板起了面孔，用手背揩去了眼泪。已经没有必要来自责与悔恨了他对自己说道。很快他不就会与她团聚了吗？到那时，他将再向她表达他永恒的爱与忠心。他点燃了字条，将它扔进了烟灰缸中，看着它慢慢地燃烧起来。在火苗的映衬下，这间漆黑的屋子里的四壁一时变得影影绰绰。不一会儿 ，火苗成了星星点点，渐渐地熄灭了。上校把香烟扔在了地板上，用后脚跟将其碾灭，随后抓起照片放在自己的胸前。他从衣兜中掏出一把手枪，将枪筒放进自己的嘴中，接着扣动了扳机。在烟灰缸中还残留着—小片字条，由于被上校的泪水浸湿而未能燃尽。在这块残片上有这样几个字“昨天去世”。\\n====================\\nNO.56:\\nEnglish:\\nAll over my garden I\\'ve planted nothing but roses, fragrant and if looked at from afar-ablaze with colour like sunset clouds. I would be very happy if any one of my visiting friends should desire to pick and take some for their homes.I trust that any friend of nune carrying the roses would vanish into the distance feeling that his emotion had been rekindled.A close friend came for a visit the other day, I know her to be a lover of flowers and plants, and for that reason I told her at her departure that she should pick a bunch of roses to decorate her boudoir. I promised that the scent ofthe roses would be wafted far, far away.That girl friend of mine, tiptoeing into the garden in high spirits, sniffed here and smelt there, but in the end she didn\\'t pick a single rose. I said there were so many of them tbat she could pick as many as she\\'d like to, I told her that I was not a florist and didn\\'t make a living out of them. While saying so I raised the scissors for the sacrifice of the flowers, but she vehemently stopped me, crying no, no, no!To cut such beautiful roses would hurt one, she said.With her hands clutching at my sleeves, she told me that by no means should they be cut. Roses are the smiling face of the earth, and who could be so iron hearted as to destroy a smile so exhilarating?My mind was thoroughly boggled: the ugly earth, the humble earth,the plain earth-it is only because of the roses that it reveals an amazing and bright smile, and it is for the sake of that smile that it wins the care and pity of men.Of late a friend of mine i_nvited me to appreciate a Tang Dynasty vase that he was fortunate enough to have bought at an auction. The vase, with its slim neck, plump body, and fine little flowers on a blue and white background, has a noble shape and a rich colouring, elegant, refined, proud, poised, and supercilious, an extreme embodiment of the prosperity of the Tang Dynasty. I was filled with wonder to think that while everyone present was talang great care not to cause the slightest damage to the Tang treasure, it was to me nothing but an object made of clay. It had only become a piece of classic art after being baked in a china kiln.Both the exqusiteness of the boccaro teapots made in south China, and the shockingly beautiful sculptures by Clay Sculptor Zhang of Tianjin aren\\'t they all smiles of the earth? They are such exquisite treasures that-even if they look ugly, humble, plain, or whatever-they no doubt deserve respect and veneration.Now I understand that no one, however ordinary, should be condemned to anonymity, and that anyone who adds a dash of colour to life deserves our respect.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n我在花园里种满了芬芳的玫瑰花，远远望去，他们像一片燃烧的晚霞。如果来访的朋友想摘些花带回家，我会很高兴。我相信朋友捧着火红的玫瑰渐渐走远的背影，一定能点燃易感的情怀。有一天，一位非常要好的女友来探望我，我知道她平素最喜欢花花草草了，临别时我说，采一束玫瑰点缀你的闺房，保证十里飘香。女友轻轻地跨进花园，东闻闻，西嗅嗅，神采飞扬，就是不肯采摘。我说没关系，多的是，并让她尽管采摘。我告诉她我又不是花店的老板，不会靠玫瑰赚钱的，说完我就举起剪刀准备献美。女友急忙拦住，高声叫着不可不可。这么美丽的玫瑰剪下来，让人心疼，她说道。她紧抓住我的袖子叮咛道：千万不能剪啊，玫瑰是泥土的微笑，谁忍心杀戮美得醉人的微笑？我的灵魂悚然一惊，丑陋的泥土、卑微的泥土、朴素的泥土，因为玫瑰，它露出了惊艳一笑。因为这一笑，它让人爱惜非常。近日，一个朋友在拍卖会上有幸购得一个花瓶，花瓶细颈大肚，碎花蓝白图案，看上去流光溢彩。从造型到色彩，整个如唐朝盛世的化身，雍容、华贵、高傲、悠闲，目空一切。朋友邀请我们大家观赏。奇怪的是每一个参观者都小心谨慎，生怕碰坏这盛唐的宝贝。其实它不过是一撮泥土而已，在经过窑烧之后才干修百炼成瓷中经典的口.江南的紫砂壶玲珑剔透，天津泥人张的彩塑令人拍案叫绝，它们不都是泥土的微笑吗？它们弥足珍贵，即使曾丑陋，即使曾卑微，即使曾朴素，同样让人肃然起敬。我懂得了，即使再平凡的人，也没有理由被埋没，只要努力活出色彩，一定会叫人刮目相看。\\n====================\\nNO.57:\\nEnglish:\\nMy brother-in-law opened the bottom drawer of my sister\\'s bureau and lifted out a tissue wrapped package.“This,\" he said, “is not a piece of paper.

The price tag with an astronomical figure on it was still attached. \"Jan bought this the first time we went to New York at least 8 0r 9 years ago. She never wore it.

Yet who would not feel now? Oh\\'twere as reckless a task to endeavor to annihilate perception while sense existed, as to blunt the sixth sense to such impressions as these! ...Forgive me, dearest friend? I pour out my whole soul to you. I write by fleeting intervals: my pen runs away with my senses. The impassionateness of my sensations grows upon me. Your letter, too, has much affected me,Never, with my consent, shall that intercourse cease which has been the day dawn of my existence, the sun which has shed warmth on the cold drear length of the anticipated prospect of life. Prejudice might demand the sacriftce, but she is an idol to whom we bow not.The world might demand it; its opinion might require; but the cloud which flees over yon mountain were as important to our happiness, to our usefulness. This must never be, never whilst this existence continues; and when time has enrolled us in the list of the departed, surely this friendship will survive to bear our identity to heaven.What is love, or friendship? Is it something material ... a ball, an apple, a plaything... which must be taken from one to be given to another? Is it capable of no extension, no communication? Lord Kaimes defines love to be a particularization of the general passion.But this is the love of sensation, of sentiment... the absurdest of absurd vanities: it is the love of pleasure,\\'not the love of happiness. The one is a love which is self-centered, self-interested: It desires its own interest, it is the parent ofjealousy. Its object is the plaything which it desires to monopolize.Selfishness, monopoly, is its very soul, and to communicate to others part ofthis love were to desrroy its essence, to annihilate this chain ofstraw.But love, the love which we worship, ...virtue, heaven, disinterestedness... in a word, friendship... which has as much to do with the senses as with yonder mountains, that which seeks the good of all... the good ofits object first, not because that object is a minister to its pleasures, not merely because it even contributes to its happiness, but because it is really worthy, because it has powers, sensibilities, is capable of abstracting itself, and loving virtue\\'s own loveliness...Desiring the happiness of others not from the obligation of fearing hell or desiring heaven: but for pure, simple, unsophistlicated virtue.

I have no way of knowing for sure that it is true, but I do know that stranger things have happened in war.Whatever their planned target, the mortar rounds landed in an orphanage run by a missionaryr group in the small Vietnamese village.The missionaries and two children were killed outright, and several more children were wounded,including one young girl, about eight years old.People from the village requested medical help from a neighboring town that had radio contact with the American forces. Finally, an American Navy doctor and nurse arrived in ajeep with onty their medical kits. They established that the girl was the most critically injured. Without quick action, she would die of shock and loss of blood.A transfusion was imperatlive, and a donor with a matching blood type was required. A quick test showed that neither American had the correct type, but several of the uninjured orphans did.The doctor spoke some pidgin Vietnamese, and the nurse a smattering of high school French. Using that combination, together with much impromptu sign language, they tried to explain to their young, frightened audience that unless they could replace some of the girl\\'s lost blood, she would certainly die. Then they asked if anyone would be willing to give blood to help.Their request was met with wide eyed silence. After several long moments, a small hand slowly and waveringly went up, dropped back down, and then went up again.\"Oh, thank you,\" the nurse said in French. \"What is your name?\"\"Heng,\" came the reply.Heng was quickly laid on a pallet, his arm swabbed with alcohol,and a needle inserted in his vein. Through this ordeal Heng lay stiff and silent.After a moment, he let out a shuddering sob, quickly covering his face with his free hand.\"Is it hurting, Heng?\" the doctor asked. Heng shook his head, but after a few moments another sob escaped, and once more he tried to cover up his crying. Again the doctor asked him if the needle hurt, and again Heng shook his head.But now his occasional sobs gave way to a steady, silent crying, his eyes screwed tightly shut, his fist in his mouth to stiflehis sobs.The medical team was concerned.Something was obviously very erong. At this point, a Vietnamese nurse arrived to help. Seeing the little one\\'s distress, she spoke to him rapidly inVietnamese, listened to his reply and answered him in a soothing voice.After a moment, the patient stopped crying and looked questioningly at the Vietnamese nurse. When she nodded, a look of great relief spread over his face.Glancing up, the nurse said quietly to the Americans, \"He thought he was dying. He misunderstood you. He thought you had asked him to give all his blood so the little girl could live.\"\"But why would he be willing to do that?\" asked the Nav}r nurse.The Vietnamese nurse repeated the question to the boy, who answered simply,¨She\\'s my friend.\"Greater love has no man than this-that he will lay down his life for a friend.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n我是在越南时听到这个故事的，而且它是被当作真事告诉我的。虽然我无法确认它是否属实，但我却知道，在战争中比这更离奇的事情都发生过。一次美军的例行炮击，击中了坐落在一个越南小村庄里的一所孤儿院，这是由一个传教团体创办的.那儿的众多传教士和两个孤儿在炮击中立刻丧命，还有更多的孩子受伤，其中包括一个8岁的小女孩。村里的人们请求附近的一个小镇给予医疗救助，因为该镇同美军部队之间有无线电联系。最后，一名美国海军的军医同他的护士带着他们的药箱乘一辆吉普车到达了该村。他们确诊这个小女孩的伤势最严重，若不立刻采取措施，她就会死于休克和失血。必须立即为她输血，而且要求找到一个血型同她相匹配的献血者．经过快速的化验，这两个美国人的血型都与小女孩不匹配，幸好有好几名未受伤的孤儿的血型都符合要求。这位军医能讲几句混杂的越南语，护士也能讲几句半生不熟的法语. 二位将他们仅有的语言技能加到一起，再加上一些即兴的手势语，努力地向这些被吓坏了的孩子们解释——除非他们能够献出一些血，来补充这个小女孩失掉的血，否则她一定会死去。然后他们问孩子们，有谁愿意献血来救活这个孩子。他们得到的回答却是孩子们睁大的眼睛和沉默。过了好久好久，才有一只小手慢慢吞吞地，犹犹豫豫地举起来接着又放下去，接着再一次举起来。\"哦．谢谢你，\"护士用法语说，“你叫什么名字？”\"恒，\"孩子管道。恒被很快地放到一张简陋的小床上，护士用酒精擦洗了他的胳膊之后，便将一根针头插进了他的静脉。在这个严酷的考验中，恒—直僵硬地躺着，默不作声。过了一会儿，他发出了一声战栗的抽泣，并且很快地用他的另外一只手掩住了自己的脸。\"痛吗，恒？\"医生问道。恒摇了摇头。可是，没过多久，他又抽泣了一声。而且他又一次竭力地掩盖自己的哭泣。于是医生再一次问他针头是否扎痛了他。然而，恒却再一次摇了摇头。可是，这时他的断断续续的抽泣已经无法克制，变成了一种持续的、无声的哭泣。他紧闭着双眼，把小拳头塞进嘴里，以控制自己的抽泣。医生和护士感到十分不安，显然有什么地方出了错。这时，终于有一位越南的护士来解围了。当她看见孩子的痛苦状态时，她很急切地用越南语对他说了几句话，在听了孩子的回答之后，她又用抚慰的声音解答了孩子的困惑。过了一会儿，小男孩停止了哭泣，然后疑惑地看着这位越南护士。当护士点头时，一种很明显的释然的表情才在孩子的脸上慢慢地展开.越南护士抬起头来，看着两个美国人，轻声地告诉他们：“他刚才以为自己要死了。他误解了你们的意思。他以为你们要他把自己所有的血都抽出来才能救活那个小女孩呢。\"“可是为什么他还愿意献血呢？”海军护士问道。越南护士又向这个男孩重复了这个问题。男孩简单地答道：“因为她是我朋友。”没有一个人有这么伟大的爱—肯为一个朋友献出自己的生命。\\n====================\\nNO.62:\\nEnglish:\\nThe Childhood DaysWhen you came into the world, she held you in her arms.

In order merely to keep food on the table, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of the children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either ofthem to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.After many long discussions at rught in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his eamings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary: also by laboring the mrnes.They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financedhis brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht\\'s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works. When the young artist retrurnedto his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht\\'s triumphant homecoming.After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head ofthe table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, \"And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your tum. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take_care of you.\" All heads tumed in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, \"No ...no ...no ...no.\" Finally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, \"No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look... look what four years in the mines has done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthrihs so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to retum your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush。No, brother ... for me it is too Iate.\"More than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer\\'s hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one ofAlbrecht Durer\\'s works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.One day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed,Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother\\'s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply \"Hands\", but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love \"The Praying Hands.\"\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n一幅名画背后的真实故事15世纪时，在德国的一个小村庄里，住着一个有18个孩子的家庭。父亲是一名冶金匠，为了维持一家生计，作为家中顶梁柱的他每天要工作18个小时，他所做的除了与冶金相关的活儿之外，还有在邻居那里寻找的一些差事。生活尽管窘迫逼人，然而这个家庭中的两个孩子却怀揣一个同样的梦想。他们两人都希望可以发展自己在艺术方面的天分。不过他们也了解，父亲无法在经济上供他们俩中的任何一个到纽伦堡艺术学院读书。晚上，两兄弟在床上经过多次讨论后，得出结论：以掷铜板决定胜者到艺术学院读书，败者则到附近的矿场工作赚钱，4年后，在矿场工作的那一个再到艺术学院读书，由学成毕业那一个赚钱支持，他可能会靠卖作品，如果需要，可能也要到矿场工作。星期日早上做完礼拜后，他们掷了铜板，结果，弟弟Albrecht Durer胜出，去了纽伦堡艺术学院。哥哥Albert则去了危险的矿场工作，4年来直为弟弟提供经济支持。Albrecht在艺术学院表现很突出，他的铜版画、木刻画和油画画得简直比教授的还要好。到毕业时，他的作品已经能赚不少钱。在这位年轻的艺术家返回家乡的那一天，家人在草坪上为他准备了盛宴，庆祝他学成归来。当漫长而难忘的宴席快要结束时，伴随着音乐和笑声，Albercht起身答谢敬爱的哥哥几年来对他的支持，并使他的梦想得以实现。他说：“现在轮到你了，亲爱的哥哥，我会全力支持你到纽伦堡艺术学院攻读，实现你的梦想！”所有的目光都急切地转移到桌子的另一端，坐在那里的脸色苍白的Albert双泪直流，只见他垂下头，边摇头边重复说着：“不……不……”终于，Albert站了起来，他擦干脸颊上的泪水，看了看长桌两边他所爱的亲友们的脸，把双手移近右脸颊，轻声地说：“不，弟弟，我上不了纽伦堡艺术学院了.太迟了.看看我的双手-4年的矿场工作，毁了我的手，最近我的右手又患有严重的关节炎，现在连举杯为你庆贺也不可能，何况是用钢笔或是笔刷在羊皮纸或帆布上画一些纤细、优美的线条呢？不，弟弟……已经太迟了．… ”450多年过去了’Albrecht Durer有成千上百部的杰作被流传下来，他的素描、水彩画、木炭画、木刻、铜刻等可以在世界各地的博物馆中找到，然而，大多数人最为熟悉的，却是其中的一件作品。也许，你的家里或者办公室里就悬挂着一件它的复制品呢。为了补偿哥哥所做的牺牲，表达对哥哥的敬意，一天，AlbrechtDurer了很大的工夫把哥哥合起向上的粗糙的双手给画了下来。他把这幅伟大的作品简单地称为“双手”，然而，全世界的人都立刻敞开心扉，瞻仰这幅杰作，并把这幅爱的作品重新命名为“祈祷之手 ”。\\n====================\\nNO.64:\\nEnglish:\\nLove is EverythingThe winter cold hung in the air like a frozen dinosaur trying to thaw from lus glacier and walk across the earth.

I became terribly nervous, I fumbled in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search. I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could barely get it to my lips. But I had no matches, they had taken those. I looked through the bars at my jailer. He did not make eye contact with me. I called out to him:\"Have you got a light?\" He looked at me, shrugged and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the match,his eyes inadvertently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don\\'t know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another,it is very hard not to smile. In any case, I smiled. In that instant, it was as though a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn\\'t want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.I kept smiling at him, now aware of him as a person and not just a jailer. And his looking at me seemed to have a new dimension too. \"Do you have kids?\" he asked. \"Yes, here, here.\" I took out my wallet and nervously fumbled for the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures ofhis family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes filled with tears. I said that I feared that I\\'d never see my familyagain, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too. Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell and silently led me out. Out of the jail, quietly and by back routes, out of the town. There,at the edge of town, he released me.

Aren\\'t they wonderful?\" There was on his face an expression of solemn and holy rapture, as if he were revealing to me the mysteries of his religion.I became far more interested in him than in the socks. I looked at him in amazement.\"My friend,\" said I, \"if you can keep this up, if this is not merely the enthusiasm that comes from novelty, from having a new job,\\nif you can keep up this zeal and excitement day after day, in ten years you will own every sock in the United States.\"My amazement at his pride and joy in salesmanship will be easily understood by all who read this article. In many shops the customer has to wait for someone to wait upon lum, And when finally some clerk does deign to notice you, you are made to feel as if you were interrupting him.Either he is absorbed in profound thought in which he hates to be disturbed or he is skylarking with a girl clerk and you feellike apologizing for thrusting yourselfinto such intimacy. He displays no interest either in you or in the goods he is paid to sell. Yet possibly tbat very clerk who is now so apathetic began his career with hope and enthusiarsm. The daily grind was too much for him; the novelty wore off; his only pleasures were found outside of working hours, He became a mechanical, not inspired, salesman. After being mechanical, he became incompetent; then he saw younger clerks who had more zest in their work, promoted over him. He became sour. That was the last stage. His usefulness was over.I have observed this melancholy decline in the lives of so many men in so many occupations that I have come to the conclusion that thesurest road to failure is to do things mechanically. There are many teachers in schools and colleges who seem duller than the dullest of their pupils; they go through the motions of teaching, but they are as impersonal as a telephone.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n一个晴朗的下午，我沿第5大街而行，忽然想起需要买双袜子。我便拐进所看到的第一家袜店，一个不到17岁的少年售货员迎上来：“先生，我能为您效劳吗？”“我想买双短袜。”他双眸是热情，声音饱含激情：“您知道您来到了世界上最好的袜店吗？_我倒并未意识到这点，我不过是随便进来的。“ 随我来，”男孩欣喜若狂地说。我跟着他往里走。他开始从货架上拽下一个又．个盒子，向我展示里面的袜子，让我欣赏。“停一停，孩子，我只买—双！”“我知道，”他说，“但我想让您瞧瞧这些袜子是多么漂亮、多么令人赞叹！难道它们不棒吗？”他的脸色庄严而虔诚，就像是在向我透露他信仰中的奥秘似的。我对他远远超过了对袜子的兴趣。我吃惊地打量着他。 “我的朋友，丹我说，“如果你能这样保持下去，如果这热情并不仅仅缘于新奇，缘于找到份新工作，如果你能日复一日地保持这种热心和激情，不出10年，全美国的每_双袜子都将是从你手中卖出去的？我对他推销时的自豪与欣喜所感到的诧异，读者们应当不难理解。在很多店铺，顾客不得不等待有人来招呼他们。当终于有个售货员肯屈尊理你，那样子又让你感觉像是打扰了他。他不是陷于讨厌被人搅扰的深思之中，就是和女售货员嬉戏调笑；而你不适时的插入打断了他们的亲呢，为此你感觉好像需要道歉似的。他显示出对你和他拿着工资去卖的东西毫无兴趣。然而，就是这样一个如此冷漠的售货员，或许当初也是满怀希望和热情开始工作的。天天枯燥乏味的苦差事令他不堪忍受，新鲜感磨去了\\'唯一的乐趣只能在工作之外找到。他成了一个机 械的、没有干劲的售货员。机械呆板之后便是笨拙无能。随后，看到比他年轻、工作热情比他高的售货员得到了提拔，在他之上，他于是变得烦躁刻薄。此时便到了他职业生涯的最后阶段。他不再有用了。我观察到，很多职业中的许多人在人生道路上都有这种可悲的堕落。由此我得出结论：机械地应付差事是离失败最近的路。大中小学里的许多教师，似乎比他们最最迟钝的学生还要呆滞，他们似乎也搐搞教学，却毫无人的感情，就如同一部电话机。\\n====================\\nNO.67:\\nEnglish:\\nYears of stonns had taken their toll on the old windmill.

For a young country just coming of age in the early 1800s, the discovery of Yellowstone helped define America\\'s identity with its vast, bold landscape.Today, Yellowstone\\'s identity is closely associated with its powerful, natural geysers such as the ever present: Old Faithful. Old Faithful erupts about every 85-87 nunutes. It is 130-140 feet tall and is magnificent.The incredible geysers and picture postcard landscape brought Yeowstone its fame. But today, its wildlife population is just as popular.The most contlroversial of these is Yellowstone\\'s wolf population. Until receritly, the wolf was almost extinct.This world has been obsessed with killing wolves. We have been killing wolves for cenUturies,probably for thousands ofyears. Afraid of the threat wolves would pose to their livestock, governmentbounty hunters in the early 1900s, killed Yellowstone s grey wolves for the price of fifteen dollars a head. They were hunted to near extinction. It would be almost a century before an effort would begin to reverse this damage,In 1995, Yellowstone\\'s wolfpopulation was almost gone, so Douglas Smith (Yellowstone\\'s Wolf Preservation Project Leader) went to Canada to capture fourteen of the animals in an effort to revive Yellowstone\\'s wolf population. Douglas said:¨Catching a wolf is a tough thing to do. And there\\'s nothing more exciting than flying over a wolfin a helicopter. You throw a net over them, they get tangled up, and then you go up and sedate them. When you move a wolf from one location to another, they try and get back home. We held them for about ten weeks inside the pens.\\'One of the transplanted wolves in particular, has had a lot to do with the parks wolf repopulation. This wolf, a female known as No.9, is one ofthe park\\'s top breeders, and 70/o of the wolves born in the park today have her genes. Wolves are now the marquee animal in Yellowstone.

Maybe you should try medltation.When people think about meditation, many picture old men sitting cross-legged on remote mountaintops. People describing meditation frequently mention elements such as gurus, relaxation, and \"tlunking about nothing\".It is not necessary to travel to a mountaintop to enjoy the benefits of meditation because it is actually more about awareness than just relaxation.The secret to meditation is breatlung.To start meditating, find a place where you can sit or stand comfortably for a little while and concentrate. Close your eyes and start taking slow breaths. Focus on the air moving in and out ofyour body, If your mind starts to wander and you begin to think about something else, refocus your attention on your breathing.Meditation has little to do with escaping problem or thinking about notlung..lnstead, the breathing techniques help you calm down and think more clearly about your feelings. The issues on your mind unfold clearly, as ifthey were in slow motion.This clarity is called \"mindfulness\". Being mindful means that you are aware of what you are thinking without becoming caught up in your thoughts. It takes practice, but with time, that big test will not scare you any more.

Outside the Bible, these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly and eagerly, or to live dully and meanly and scarcely. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answeredit by saying:¨Ithink, therefore Iam.”But the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: \"To be is to be in relations.\" If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But apart from our regular occupation how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concemed-poetry and prose, music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, intemational affairs-you are dead. Contrariwise, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest-even more, a new accomplishment-you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in a large variety of subjects can remain unhappy, the real pessimist is the person who has lost interest. Baam said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts, new friends. What is supremely true ofliving objects is not less true of ideas, which are also alive. Where your thoughts are, there will your live be also. Ifyour thoughts are confined to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to the narrow circle of the town in which\\'you live, then you live in a narrow circumscribed life. But if you are interested what is going on in China, then you are living in China if you\\'te interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people, if you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.To be or not to be to live intensely and richly, merely to exist, that depends on ourselves. Let us widen and intensify our relations. While we live, let us live !\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n“活着还是不活。”如果把《圣经》除外，这6个字便是整个世界文学中最有名的6个字了．这6个字是哈姆雷特一次喃喃自语时说的，而这6个字也就成了莎士比亚作品中最有名的几个字了，因为这里哈姆雷特不仅道出了他自己的心声，同时也代表了一切有思想的男男女女。活着还是不活——是要生活还是不要生活，是要生活得丰满充实、兴致勃勃，还是活得枯燥委琐、贫乏无味。 一位哲人一次曾想弄清他自己是否是在活着，这个问题我们每个人也大可不时地问问我们自己。这位哲学家对此的答案是：“我思故我在。”但是关于生存我所见过的一条最好的定义却是另一位哲学家下的：“生活即是联系。”如果这话不假的话，那么一个有生命者的联系越多，它也就越有生气。所谓要活得丰富充实也即是要扩大和加强我们的各种联系。不幸的是，我们往往会因为天性不够丰厚而容易陷入自己的陈规旧套。试问除去我们的日常工作，我们的真正生活又有多少？如果你只是对你的日常工作才有兴趣，那你的生活也就很有限了。至于在其他事物方面—一比如诗歌、散文、音乐、美术、体育、无私的友谊、政治与国际事务，等等——你只是死人一个。 但反过来说，每当你获得一种新的兴趣_—．甚至一项新的造诣——你就增长了你的生活动力。一个能对许许多多事物都深感兴趣的人是不可能总不愉快的，真正的悲观者只能是那些丧失兴趣的人。墙根曾讲过，一个人失去朋友即是死亡。但是凭着交往、凭着新朋，我们就能获得再生。这条对于活人可谓千真万确的道理，在一定程度上也完全适用于人的思想，它们也都是活的。你的思想之所在，也是你的生命之所在。如果你的思想走不出你的业务范围，走不出你的物质利益，走不出你所在城镇的狭隘圈子，那么你的一生便也只是多方受着局限的狭隘的一生。但是如果你对当前中国那里所发生的种种感兴趣，那么你便可说也活在中国，如果你对一本绝妙小说中的人物感兴趣，你便是活在一批极有趣的人们中间；如果你能全神贯注地听点好的音乐，你就会超脱出你的周围环境而活在一个充满激情与想象的神奇世界之中。活着还是不活——活得热烈、活得丰富，还是只是简单存在，这就全在我们自己。但愿我们都能不断阔展和增强我们的各种联系。只要一天我们活著，就要一天是在活着。\\n====================\\nNO.77:\\nEnglish:\\nYouth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind;It is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees;It is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions,It is the fresbness ofthe deep springs of life.Youth means a tempera-mental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.

They dream big dreams and then display great courage to do things that others say cannot be done.Your dreams form the foundation of success. Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids.As they grow older, they are simply too caught up with their work actiivities that they fail to discover what they really want to pursue in life. They find themselves trapped in a routine work system that can potentially rob them of their dreams.To get you back on track to pursue your dreams, follow these steps:Learndream again: We are bom to dream. Children often share their dreams and what want to be when they grow up.But we hear of teachers yelling in school: \"Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!\" Parents, too, have shrieked: \"Stop dreaming and get on with your homework!\" Leaming and growing up in such an environment, one may regard dreaming as an unproducdve act. As children grow up, they are told to forget their dreams and be prachcal because they are living in a\"real\" world In the end, many do get \"realistic\" and give up their dreams eventually.Dream big dreams: Never set mental ooundaries on what you are capable of achieving. Dreams are free anyway, so as long as you are dreanung, you might as well dream big. Many people cannot realize their dreams and achieve greater success because they limit theirrown beliefs.Flee from dream killers: Dream killers are devastating to your success. Your friends, colleagues, and even loved ones can be one of your dream killers. There are people who will try to dtstract, confuse, or persuade you to build the life they want, not the life that you want.Stop listening to the people who tell you why you will not achieve your dreams. You just need to believe you can do whatever it is you want to do.Other people can only discourage us temporarily, but you are the only one who can prevent yourself from being discouragedStop giving excuses: Kids talk frequently about what they can do, whereas many adults do the opposite. Adults tend to talk about what they cannot do and why.You should stop giving reasons why you cannot achieve your dreams, Many so-called reasons are merely excuses.If you continue giving excuses for not achieving, it will not take long before you convince yourself that you really cannot accomplish what you originally set out to achieve.As Henry Ford wisely put it: \"Whether you think you can or cannot, you\\'re absolutely right.\"Take action immediately: Once you have big and clear dreams, take immediate action to work towards making them come true. Very often ，if people do not translate their intenhon into action soon their passion will begin to diminish.Weeks later, the passion will grow cold and months later, that passion may be gone forever. Think about this: Five birds are resting on the fence and minutes later, three birds decide to fly off to search for food. How many birds are Ieft on the fence?TWO? Wrong! There should still be five birds on the fence because deciding to fly offis not the same as the actual act of flying off. The birds would not be able to food until they start to take action and fly out of their comfort zone.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n成功人士通常都有一个梦。他们抱有很大的梦想，然后凭借巨大的勇气去完成那些其他人认为无法完成的事情。你的梦想构建了成功的基石，许多人早已忘记他们儿时的梦想，当他们长大成人后，又只是整天忙于工作而没能发现他们在生活中真正想追求的东西，他们发现自己陷于日常生活事物中，而这很有可能会掠走他们的梦想。要回到追求梦想的道路，请遵循以下步骤：学会再次做梦：我们天生就会做梦。 孩子经常与人分享他们的梦想以及他们对长大后想做些什么的憧憬。然而，我们经常听到学校老师的训斥：“别做梦了，注意听讲！”家长们也常常喝斥我们：“别做梦了，快点做功课！”在这样的环境中学习和成长，人们会把做梦当作一种徒劳无益的行为。随着孩子们的成长，他们被灌输的是忘记梦想，实际一些，因为他们生活在一个“现实的”世界里。结果是许多人确实变得“现实”了 ，最终放弃了他们的梦。敢于做伟大的梦: 永远不要给自己有能力做到的事情设定心理界限。既然梦想是免费的，既然你已在做梦，为什么不放飞你的梦想呢？许多人不能实现自己的梦想，不能取得更大的成功，就是因为他们束缚了自己的信念。摆脱梦想杀手：梦想杀手是你走向成功的死敌。你的朋友、同事甚至你所爱的人都可能成为你的梦想杀手。有些人将试图让你分心、扰乱你的心绪或是劝说你去过他们想要的而不是你想要的生活。不要听信那些用各种理由阻拦你，说你无法实现自己梦想的人。你只需要相信自己能做到任何想做的事。其他人只能暂时让你灰心，而能够永远激励你的人只有你自己。不要再给自己找借口:孩子常常说他们能做什么，而许多成年人正好相反。成年人总是感叹他们做不了什么，并编出各种理由。你应该停止为自己无法实现梦想而找理由。许多所谓的理由仅仅是借口。如果你继续为失败找借口的话，你很快就会使自己确信你真的无法达到你最初设定的目标。正如亨利·福特的至理名言所说：“无论你认为自己行，还是不行，你都绝对是正确的口”立即采取行动：_旦你有了伟大并且明确的梦想，马上采取行动去把它们变为现实。在大多数情况下，如果人们没有及时将计划付诸行动的话，他们的热情就会开始减弱。几周后，热情就会冷却，数月后，也许就会永远消失。请思考这个问题：5只鸟在篱笆上休息，几分钟后，3只决定飞走去寻找食物。篱笆上还剩几只鸟呢？两只？错误！篱笆上应该还有5只鸟，因为决定飞走并不等于有飞走的实际行动。只有当它们真正采取行动并且飞出他们的安乐窝，它们才能找到食物。\\n====================\\nNO.82:\\nEnglish:\\nThough there is much to be concerned about, there is far, far more for which to be thankful.

The absence of it is not an assured ground of condemnation, but the presence of it is an invariable sign of goodness of heart.In proportion to the degree in which it is felt will probably be the degree in which nobleness and beauty of character will be attained.Natural beauty is an all-pervading presence. The universe is its temple. It unfolds into the numberless flowers of spring. It waves in the branches of trees and the green blades of grass. It haunts the depths of the earth and the sea. It gleams from the hues ofthe shell and the precious stone. And not only these minute objects but the oceans, the mountains, the clouds, the stars, the rising and the setting sun-all overfiow with beauty. This beauty is so precious, and so. congenial to our tenderest and noblest feelings, that it is ptunfuI to think of the multitude ofpeople living in the midst of it and yet remairung almost lind to it.All persons should seek to become acquainted with the beauty in nature. There is not a worm we tread upon, nor a leaf that dances merrily as it falls before the autumn winds, but calls for our study and admiration. The power to appreciated beauty not merely increases our sources of happiness-it enlarges our moral nature, too. Beauty calms our restlessness and dispels our cares. Go into the fields or the woods, spend a summer day by the sea or the mountains, and all your little perplexities and anxieties will vanish. Listen to sweet music, and your foolish fears and petty jealousies will pass away. The beauty of the world helps us to seek and find the beauty of goodness.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n爱美是整个健全的人性所不可或缺的一部分。它是一种道德品质。缺乏这种品质并不能作为受到责难的充分理由，但是拥有这种品质则是心灵美好的永恒标志。品德的高尚与美好所达到的程度可能与对美的感受程度成正比。大自然的美无处不在，整个宇宙就是美的殿堂。美，在春日百花中绽放，美，在绿叶嫩枝间摇曳；美，在深海幽谷里游弋，美，在奇石与贝壳的缤纷色彩中闪烁。不只是这些细微之物，还有海洋、山川、云彩、繁星和日升日落——切都是洋溢着美。这样的美是如此珍贵，与我们最温柔、最高尚的情愫是如此相宜，以至于想到很多人置身于美之中，却几乎对它熟视无睹，就会觉得痛心不已。所有的人都应该去认识大自然之美，没有一条我们踩过的小虫、没有一片在秋风拂掠之际飞舞的树叶不值得我们研究与赞赏。欣赏美的能力不仅增加了我们快乐的来源，也加强了我们德性的修养。美使我们不安的心平静下来，也驱散了我们的忧虑。到田野或森林去，在夏日的海边或山上待上一天，那么你所有微不足道的困惑与焦虑都会烟消云散。倾听悦耳的音乐，你那愚蠢的恐惧与狭隘的嫉妒都会过去。世界之美将有助于我们找到为善之美。\\n====================\\nNO.84:\\nEnglish:\\nJust for today I will try to live through this day only and not tackle my whole life problem at once.

In more recent times, this truth has been expressed as: April showers bring May flowers. This is a truth that promises light bursting from darkness, strength born from weakness and if one dares to believe,life emerging from death.Farmers all over the world know the importance and immutability of the seasons. They know that there is a season to plant and a season to harvest; everything must be done in its own time. Although the rain pours down with the utmost relentlessness, ceasing all outdoor activities, the man of the field lifts his face to the heavens and smiles. Despite the inconvenience, he knows that the rain provides the nourishment his crops need to grow and fiourish. The torrenhal rains in the month ofApril, give rise to the glorious flowers in the month of May.But this ancient truth applies to more than the crops of the fields; it is an invaluable message of hope to all who experience tragedy in life. A dashed relationship with one can open up the door to a brand new friendship with another. A lost job here can provide the opportunity for a better job there. A broken dream can become the foundation of a wonderful future. Everything has its place.Remember this: overwhelming darkness may endure for a night but it will never overcome the radiant light of the moming. When you are in a season of sorrow, hang in there, because a season ofjoy may be just around the comer ..\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n从美国中西部金色的田野，到巴勒斯坦嫩绿色的古老疆土，那些留心观察的人们共享着同一个快乐的真理。近来这—真理被阐述为：4月的雨带来5月的花。这真理预示着光明会从黑暗中发，刚强生自软弱；如果你敢确信，生命会从死亡中萌发！全世界的农民们都明白季节的重要性和永恒性。他们知道在哪个季节播种，在哪个季节收获，每件事都必须应时而做！ 虽 然暴雨无情地倾盆而下，并迫使所有的户外劳作停止，但土地的主人会仰天微笑。尽管有诸多不便，但是他知道，雨会为他的庄稼带来繁茂生长所需的营养。 4月里的豪雨，会带来5月里的繁花似锦。但是这一古老真理并不只适用于田里的庄稼，它还是那些正经历着人生磨难的人的无限希冀：一段友谊的受挫会开启另一段崭新友谊的大门此处失去的工作会提供彼处更好的工作机会；一个梦想的破灭会成为美好未来的基石。万物皆有道！请谨记：势不可挡的黑暗或许会持续一晚，但它永远无法阻挡清晨的万丈光芒！当你正处于悲伤之季，请坚持住，因为欢乐的季节也许马上就会到来……\\n====================\\nNO.86:\\nEnglish:\\nHowever mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names.

Others may have undergone, or may still be liable to them-we \"bear a charmed life\", which laughs to scom all such sickly fancies. As in setting out on delightful journey，we strain our eager gaze forward. Bidding the lovely scenes at distance hail! And see no end to the landscape, new objects presenting themselves as we advance, so, in the commencement of life, we set no bounds to our inclinations, nor to the unrestricted opportunities of gratifying them. we have as yet found no obstacle, no disposition to flag; and it seems that we can go on so forever. We look round in a new world, full of life, and motion, and ceaseless progress; and feel in ourselves aU the vigor and spirit to keep pace with it, and do not foresee from any present symptoms how we shall be left behind in the natural course of things, decline into old age, and drop into the grave.It is the simplicity, and as it were abstractedness of our feelings in youth, that (so to speak) identifies us with nature, and (our experience being slight and our passions strong) deludes us into a belief of being immortal like it. Our short-lives connection with existence we fondly flatter ourselves, is an indissoluble and lasting union-a honeymoon that knows neither coldness, jar, nor separation. As infants smile and sleep, we are rocked in the cradle of our wayward fancies, and lulled into security by the roar ofthe ruuverse around us.We quaff the cup oflife with eager haste without draining it, instead ofwhich it only overflows, the more objects press around us, filling the mind with their magnitude and with the strong of desires that wait upon them, so that we have no room for the thoughts of death.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n年轻人不相信自己会死。这是我哥哥的话，可以说算得上一句妙语。青春有一种永生之感——它能弥补一切。人在青年时代就好像一尊永生的神灵。诚然，生命的一半已以消逝，但蕴藏着数不尽的财富的另一半还为我们保留在那里，我们对它也抱着无穷的希望和幻想。未来的时代完全属于我们。无限辽阔的远景在我们面前展现，死亡，老年，不过是毫无意义的空话，我们听了\\'只当耳边风，全不放在心上。这些事，别人也许经历过，或者可能要承受，但是我们自己，“在灵符护佑下度日\"，对于诸如此类脆弱的念头，统统付之轻蔑的一笑。像是刚刚走上喻快的旅程，我们极目远眺，向远方的美景欢呼！此时，但觉好风光应接不暇，而且，前程更有美不胜收的新鲜景致。在这生活的开端，我们听任自己的志趣驰骋，放手给它们一切满足的机会。到此为止，我们还没有碰上过什么障碍，也没有感觉到什么疲惫，因此觉得还可以_直这样向前走去，直到永远。 我们看到四周一派新天地——生机盎然、变动不居、日新月异；我们觉得自己活力充盈、精神饱满，可与宇宙并驾齐驱。而且，眼前也无任何迹象可以证明，在大自然的发展过程中，我们自己也会落伍、衰老、进入坟墓。由于年轻人天真单纯，可以说是茫然无知，因而将自己跟大自然划上等号；并且，由于经验少而感情盛，误以为自己也能和大自然一样永世长存。我们一厢情愿，我们痴心妄想，竟把自己在世上的暂时栖身，当作千古不变、万世长存的结合，好像没有冷淡、争执、离别的密月。像婴儿带着微笑人睡，我们躺在用自己编织成的摇篮里，让大干世界的万籁之声催哄我们安然入梦，我们急切切、兴冲冲地畅饮生命之杯，怎么也不会饮干，反而好像永远是满满欲溢；森罗万象纷至沓来，各种欲望随之而生，使我们腾不出工夫想死亡的问题。\\n====================\\nNO.93:\\nEnglish:\\nTo a large degree, the measure of our peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present moment.lrrespective of what happened yesterday or last year, and what may or may not happen tomorrow, the present moment is where you are -always.Without question, many of us have mastered the neurotic art of spending much of our lives worrying about a variety of things all at once.We allow past problems and future concems to dominate our present moments, so much so that we end up anxious, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. On the flip side, we also postpone our gratification, our stated priorities, and our happiness, often convincing ourselves that\"someday\"will be better than today, Unfortunately, the same mental dynamics that tell us to look toward the future will only repeat themselves so that¨someday\" never actually arrives. John Lennon once said: \"Life is what\\'s happening while we\\'re busy making other plans.\" When we\\'re busy making“other plans\", our children are busy growing up, the people we love are moving away and dying, our bodies are getting out of shape, and our dreams are slipping away Inshort, we miss out our life.Many people live as if life were a dress rehearsal for some later date. It isn\\'t. In fact, no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow. Now is the only time we have, and the only time that we have any control over. When our attention is in the present moment, we push fear from our minds. Fear is the concem over events that might happen in the future -we won\\' t have enough money, our children will get into trouble, we will get old and die, whatever.To combat fear, the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present: Mark Twain said, \"I have been through some terrible tlungs in my life, some of which actually happened.\" I don\\'t think I can say it any better, Practice keeping your attention on the here and now. Your effortswill pay great dividends.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n我们内心是否平和在很大程度上是由我们是否能生活在现时中所决定的。 不管昨天或去年发生了什么，不管明天可能发生或不发生什么，现时才是你时时刻刻所在之处。毫无疑问，我们很多人掌握了_一种神经兮兮的艺术，即把生活中的大部分时间花在为种种事情担心忧虑上——而且常常是同时忧虑许多事情。我们任凭过去的麻烦和未来的担心控制我们此时此刻的生活，以至于我们整日焦虑不安，萎靡不振，甚至沮丧、绝望。而另—方面我们又推迟我们的满足感、推迟我们应优先考虑的事情、推迟我们的幸福感，并且常常说服自己“有朝一日”会比今天更好。不幸的是，如此告诫我们朝前看的大脑动力只能重复来重复去，以致“有朝一日”永远不会真正来临。约翰·列农曾经说过：“生活就是当我们忙于制定别的计划时发生事。”当我们忙于制定种种“别的计划”时，我们的孩子在忙于长大，我们挚爱的人离去了，甚至快去世了\\'我们的体型变样了，而我们的梦想也悄然溜走了。一句话，我们错过了生活。许多人的生活好像是某个未来日子的彩排。情况并非如此。事实上，没人能保证他或她明天肯定还活着。现在是我们所拥有的唯一时间，现在也是我们能控制的唯一时间。当我们将注意力在此时此刻时，我们就会将恐惧置于脑后。恐惧就是我们担忧某些事情会在未来发生一一我们不会有足够的钱，我们的孩子会惹上麻烦，我们会变老、会死去，诸如此类。若要克服恐惧心理，最佳策略便是学会将你的注意力拉回此时此刻。马克·吐温说过：“我经历过生活中一些可怕的事情，有些的确发生过。”我想我说不出比这更具内涵的话。经常将注意力集中于此情此景、此时此刻，你的努力终会有丰厚的报偿。\\n====================\\nNO.94:\\nEnglish:\\nToday I Begin a New LifeToday I shed my old skin which has, too long, suffered the bruises of failure and the wounds ofmediority,Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all.Today I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generation.Today I will savor the taste of grapes frornthese vines and verily I will swallow the seed ofsuccess buried in each and new life will sprout within me.The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heart break and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth.Yet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream.Failure no longer will be my payment for struggle. Just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accqpted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams. Time teaches aU things to him who lives forever but I have not the luxury of etemity. Yet within my allotted time I must prachce the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. To create the olive, king ofall trees, a hundred years is required. An onion plant is old in nine weeks. I have lived as an onion plant. It has not pleased me, Now I would become the geatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesman.And how will this be accomplished? For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve the greatness and already I have stumbled ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity. The answer is simple. I will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly.In truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course ofinstruction devours men\\'s years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessar}r to acquire her special wisdom. The end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow.Only principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatnesss are contained in the words of these scroUs. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but oneway. Failure is man\\'s inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.In truth,the difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the fust law I will obey, which precedeth aU others is-l will form good habits and become their slave.As a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits,as are all grown men. I have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already markedout a path which threatens to imprison my future . My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst ofthese tyrants is habit. Therefore, ifl must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed.I will form good habits and become their slave.And how will Iaccomplish this difficult feat? Through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success. For it is another ofnature\\'s laws that only a habit can subdue another habit So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myselfwith the first ofmy new habits which is as follows:I will read each scroll for tlurty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. First, I will read the words in silence when I arise. Then, I will read the words in silence after I have partaken of my midday meal. Last, I will read the words again just before I retire at day\\'s end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud.On the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in that manner for thirty days. Then, I will tum to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days, I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habitAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man\\'s accomplishments.As I repeat the wordsdaily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend.As the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each moming, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow.Eventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to. react, and soon\\nthese actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easy.Thus a new and good habit is bom, for when an act becomes easy throug,h constant repetiton it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man\\'s nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will.Today I begin a new life.And I make a solemn oath to myselfthat nothing will retard my new life\\'s growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not , I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine.As I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity ofits words to cause me to treat the scroll9s message lightly. Th. ousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grape skin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Much has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies disfilled in the words to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow.Today my old slan has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n今天我将开始新的生活今天，我爬出满是失败创伤的老茧。今天，我重新来到这个世上，我出生在葡萄园中，园内的葡萄任人享用。今天，我要从最高最密的藤上摘下智慧的果实，这葡萄藤是好几代前的智者种下的。今天，我要品尝葡萄的美味，还要吞下每一位成功的种子，让新生命在我心里萌芽。我选择的道路充满机遇，也有辛酸与绝望，失败的同伴数不胜数，叠在一起，投下的阴影比世界上任何的金字塔还高。然而，我不会像他们一样失败，因为我手中持有航海图，它可以指引我越过汹涌的大海，抵达梦中的彼岸失败不再是我奋斗的代价。正如天性不允许我的身体容忍疼痛一样，也不允许我遭受失败。如同疼痛，它们和我，就像水火一样，互不相容。我不再像过去一样接受它们。我要在智慧的指引下，走出失败的阴影，步入富足、健康、快乐的乐园，这些都超出了我以往的梦想。我要是能长生不老，就可以学到一切，但我不能永生，所以，在有限的人生里，我必须学会忍耐的艺术，因为大自然的行为一向是从容不迫的。造物主创造树中之王——橄榄树需要一百年的时间，而洋葱经过短短的9个星期就会枯老。我经历过洋葱式的生活，那种生活并不能使我满足。我要成为万树之王——橄榄树，成为现实生活中最伟大的推销员。怎么可能？我既没有渊博的知识，又没有丰富的经验，况且，我曾一度跌人愚昧与自怜的深渊。答案很简单。我不会让所谓的知识或者无谓的经验妨碍我的行程。造物主已经赐予了我足够的知识和本能，这份天赋是其他生物所望尘莫及的。经验的价值往往被高估了，人老的时候开口讲的多是糊涂话。说实在的，经验确实能教给我们很多东西，只是这需要花费太长的时间。等到人们获得智慧的时候，其价值已随着时间的消逝而减少了。结果往往是这样，经验丰富了’人也余生无多。经验好比时尚，适合于今天的行为，并不意味着在明天仍然行得通。只有原则是持久的，而我现在正拥有了这些原则。这些可以指引我走向成功的原则全写在这几张羊皮卷里。它们教我更多的是如何避免失败，而不只是获得成功，因为成功更是一种精神状态。人们对于成功的定义，是仁者见仁，智者见智，而失败却往往只有一种解释：失败就是一个人没能达到他的人生目标，不论这些目标是什么。事实上，成功者与失败者毛利的最大差异，在于各自不同的习惯。好习惯是开启成功的钥匙，坏习惯则是一扇向失败敞开的门。因此，我首先要做的便是养成良好的习惯，全心全意去实行。小时候，我经常会感情用事，长大成人了，我要用良好的习惯代替一时的冲动。我的自由意志屈服于多年养成的恶习，它们威胁着我的前途。我的行为受到品味、情感、偏见、欲望、爱、恐惧、环境和习惯的影响，其中最厉害的就是习惯。因此，如果我必须受习惯支配的话，那就让我受好习惯的支配。那些坏习惯必须戒除，我要在新的田地里播种好的种子。我要养成良好的习惯，全心全意去实行。这不是轻而易举的事情，要怎样才能做到呢？靠这些羊皮卷就能做到。因为每一卷里都写着一个原则，可以摒除一项坏习惯，换取一个好习惯，使人进步，走向成功。这也是自然法则之．，只有一种习惯才能抑制另一种习惯。所以，为了走好我选择的道路，我必须养成的第一个习惯是：每张羊皮卷用30天的时间阅读，然后再进人下一 卷。清晨即起，默默诵读，午饭之后，再次默读，夜晚睡前，高声朗读。第二天的情形完全一样。这样重复30天后，就可以打开下一卷了o每一卷都依照同样的方法读上3 0天，久而久之，它们就成为一种习惯了。这些习惯有什么好处呢？这里隐含着人类成功的秘诀。当我每天重复这些话的时候，它们组成了我精神活动的一部分，更重要的是，它们渗入到我的心灵。在这个神秘的世界里，它们永不静止，创造梦境，并在不知不觉中影响我的行为。当这些羊皮卷上的文字，被我奇妙的心灵完全吸收之后，我每天都会充满活力地醒来。我从来没有这样精力充沛过。我更有活力、更有热情，要向世界挑战的欲望克服了-一切恐惧与不安。在这个充满争斗和悲伤的世界里，我竟然比以前更快活。最后，我会发现自己从羊皮卷上学来了应付一切情况的办法。不久，这些办法就能运用自如。因为，任何方法，只要多练习，就会变得简单易行。经过多次重复，一种看似复杂的行为就变得轻而易举，实行起来，就会有无限的乐趣，有了乐趣，出于人之天性，我就更乐意常去实行。于是，一种好的习惯便诞生了’习惯又成为自然。既是一种好的习惯，它也就成为了我的意愿。今天，我开始新的生活。我郑重地发誓，绝不让任何事情妨碍我新生命的成长。在阅读这些羊皮卷的时候，我绝不浪费一天的时间，因为时光一去不返，失去的日子是无法弥补的。我也绝不打破每天阅读的习惯。事实上，每天在这些新习惯上所花费的少许时间，相对于可能获得的愉乐与成功而言，只是微不足道的代价。当我反复阅读羊皮卷中的字句时，我绝不能让自己因为文字的精炼而忽视内容的深沉。一瓶葡萄美酒需要千百颗果子酿制而成，果皮和渣子被抛给小鸟。葡萄的智慧代代相传，有些被过滤，有些被淘汰，随风飘逝。只有纯正的真理才是永恒的。它们就精炼在我要阅读的文字中。我要依照指示，饮下成功的种子，绝不浪费一滴。今天，我的老茧化为尘埃。我在人群中昂首阔步，不会有人认出我来，因为我不再是过去的自己、我已拥有新的生命。\\n====================\\nNO.95:\\nEnglish:\\nThe Life I DesiredThat must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace.It reminds you ofa placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vast sea, but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indiflerent, that you are.troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness. Perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share ofthe great majority , something anuss.I recognized its social value.

These passions, like great winds, haveblown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean ofanguish, reaching to the verge of despair.I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would have sacrificed all the rest oflife for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the run of the world into cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union oflove I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what-at last-l have found,With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men, I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds away above the flux. A little of this, but not much, l have achieved.Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth.Echoes of cries of pain reverberated in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world ofloneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery ofwhat human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.This has been my life. I have found it worth living,and I would gladly live it again ifthe chance were offered to me.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n3种简单却极其强烈的情感主宰着我的生活：对爱的渴望、对知识的追求、对人类痛苦的难以承受的怜悯之心。这3种情感，像一阵阵飓风—样，任意地将我吹的飘来荡去，越过痛苦的海洋，抵达绝望的彼岸。我寻找爱，首先，因为它令人心醉神迷，这种沉醉是如此美妙，以至于我愿意用余生来换取那几个小时的快乐。我寻找爱，其次是因为它会减轻孤独，—旦置身于那种可怕的孤独之中，你那颤抖的灵魂就会处在世界的边缘，而你所看到的也只是冰冷的、死寂的、无底深渊。我寻找爱，还因为在真爱交融之时，在一个神秘的缩影中，我见到了先贤和诗人们所想象的、预览的天堂。这就是我所追求的，尽管对于凡人来说，这好像是一种奢望。但这是我最终找到的。我曾以同样的热情来追求知识。我希望能理解人类的心灵，希望能知道为什么星星会发光。我也曾经努力理解毕达哥拉斯学派的理论，他们认为数字主载着万物的此消彼长。我了解了一点知识，但是不多.爱和知识，可以最大可能地将人带入天堂。可是，怜悯总是将我带回地面。人们因痛苦而发出的哭声在我心中久久回响，那些饥荒中的孩子们、被压迫者摧残的受害者们、被子女视为可憎负担的、无助的老人侗，以及那无处不在的孤单、贫穷和痛苦都在讽刺着人类所本应该拥有的生活。我渴望能够消除人世间的邪恶，可是力不从心，我自己也同样遭受着它们的折磨。这就是我的生活。我觉得活一场是值得的。如果给我机会的话，我愿意开心地再活一次。\\n====================\\nNO.98:\\nEnglish:\\nToday, look at the blue sky, hear the grass growing beneath your feet, inhale the scent of spring, let the fruits of the earth linger on your tongue, reach out and embrace those you love.

No season is awaited so eagerly or welcomed so warmly as spring...Each year I am astonished by the wealth of flowers the season gives us: the subtlety of the wild primroses and violets, the rich palette of crocus in the parks, tall tulips and proud trumpeting daffodils.Picture this: The air and the earth interpenetrated in the warm gusts of spring; the soil was full of sunlight, and the sunlight full of red dust. The air one breathed was saturated with earthy smells, and the grass under foot had a reflection ofblue sky in it.Every spring is the only spring, a perpetual astonishment.In those vernal seasons ofthe year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature not to go out and see her riches, and part.ake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth.\\n____________________\\nChinese:\\n今天，仰望蓝天，聆听小草在脚下生长，呼吸春天的气息，细细品尝大地的果实，然后放开双手拥抱你的所爱。让上帝唤醒你那神圣的知觉。这真是一个奇迹无论冬天多么漫长，无论霜雪多么严寒，自然总能获胜。没有哪个季节像春天那么让人翘首企盼……每年春花的烂漫总让我惊讶不已：野生报春花和紫罗兰的娇嫩，公园里藏红花的多彩，还有高大的郁金香和傲然的水仙花。想象这样一幅图景：温暖的春风弥漫着泥土的气息，阳光照射着每一寸土壤，土壤把阳光染成深红色。空气中渗透着泥土的清香，脚下的小草与头上的蓝天遥相呼应。每个春天都是独一无二的，是自然界永恒的奇迹。在春天这个季节里，当天朗气清的时候,如果不到室外理赏大自然的丰饶，并分享天地的喜悦，就是对它的一种伤害和亵渎。\\n====================\\nNO.99:\\nEnglish:\\nI like to joke that I am who I am today because I did everything wrong in my 20\\'s. I\\'ve always been fearless, and it often got me in trouble. I wasn\\'t afraid to start a business, borrow a bunch of money, or quit a well-paying job to travel the world.At the same time, the fact that I took chances (and often failed) gave me the wisdom that I have today.

I know enough to be certain that I lost most of my twenties to a struggle with debt and poor decisions. If I had done things differently, maybe I could have been where I am now at age 22,Could you imagine? Self employed and almost finacianciall independent at age 22? No... not almost. My expenses were much less back then... I would have been financially freefI know, it doesn\\'t do any good to ask what if. If I had known it all at age 22: I probably would have been a little cocky.

author also strongly disparages the tendency ofmost people to work for money rather than  letting money work for themkiyosaki illustrates his point in the first part ofthe book by narrating a story based on his childhood experiences, the title refers to the authors own highly educated father, the  poor dad who always had to work hard to meet the familys and the rich dad, a neighbor who had dropped out of high school but those financial acumen turned him into a multhnillionaire whose financial acumen turned himthe book has generated its share of negativefeedback for one thing,some

that there is a fairly straightforward relationship between effort and result in exams, if you work verr, very hard in the evenings you are going to do an awful lot better than if you spend your

and around and hearing people applaud for me when i was young,i would twirl around and around in the fields of wildflowers that grew in my backyardi thought that if i twirled faster everything would

be at homewhen my parents were home, my mother just yelled and criticized because nothing was ever perfect in her life she dreamed of a different life but she ended up living in the country far away from the city where she believed her dreams would have come truei enjoyed hanging out by the water i would sit there for hours and stare at my reflection there i was, looking nothing like a pretty ballerina dancer reflections dont lie once the waves would come, my reflection was gone washed away just like my dream to danceas i grew older, i began to realize that the reason my dream was even born, was because it was something that was inside of me the dream i had was never nurtured and cared for, so it slowly died its not that i wanted it to die, but i allowed it to die the day i started listening to the words, you cant do it when i finally woke up from many years of dreaming, i realized that you cant settle for dancing in the wildflowers, you have to move on to the platformchinese

the mistakes and errors with which history is filled we should all be concerned about the future because that is where we will spend the reminder of our livesthe past is gone and static nothing we can do will change it the future is before us and dynamic everything we do wiu effect it each day will brings with it new frontiers, in our homes and in our businesses, if we will only recognize them we are just at the beginning of the progress in every field ofhuman endeavorchinese noenglishlife is a doityourself projectan elderly carpenter was ready to retire he told his employer of his plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely life with his wife enjoying his extended family he would miss the paycheck, but he needed to retire they could get bythe employer was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor the carpenter said yes, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work he resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials it was an unfortunate way to end his careerwhen the carpenter finished his work and the employer came to inspect the house and handed the frontdoor key to the carpenter this is your house, he said, my gift to youwhat a shock what a shame if he had only known he was building his own house he would have done it all so differently now he had to live in the home he had built none too wellso it is with us we build our lives in a distracted way, reacting rather than acting, willing to put up less than the best at important points we do not give thejob our best effort then with a shock we look at the situation we have created and find that we are now living in the house we have builtif we had realized, we would have done it differentlythink of yourself as the carpenter think about your house each day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall build wisely it is the only life you will ever build even if you live it for only one day more, that day deserves to be lived graciously and with dignity the plaque on the wall says, life is a doityourself project who could say it more clearly your life tomorrow will be the result of your attitudes and the choices you make todaychinese  noenglishblue dayseverybody has blue daysthese are nuserable days when you feel lousy, grumpy, lonely, and utterly exhausteddays when you feel small and insignificant, when everything seemsjust out of reachyou cant rise to the occasionjust getting started seems impossibleon blue days you can become paranoid that everyone is out to get youthis is not always such a bad thingyou feel frustrated and anxious, which can induce a nailbiting frenzy that can escalate into a tnplechocolatemudcakeeating frenzy in a blink of an eyeon blue days you feellike youre fioating in an ocean of sadnessyoure about to burst into tears at any moment and you dont even know whyuntimately, you feel like youre wandering through life without purposeyoure not sure how much longer you can hang on, and you feel like shouting, will someone please shoot meit doesnt take much to bring on a blue dayyou might just wake up not feeling or looking your bestchinesenoenglishrelish the momenttucked away in our subconscious is an idyllic vision we see ourselves on a long trip that spans the continent we are traveling by trainout the windows, we druk in the passing scene of cars on nearby highways, of children waving at a crossing, of cattle grazing on a distant hillside, of smoke pouring from a power plant, of row upon row of corn and wheat, of flatlands and valleys, of mountains and rolling hillsides, of city skylines and village hallsbut upper most in our minds is the final destination on a certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station bands will be playing and flags wavingonce we get there, so many wonderful dreams will come true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed saw puzzle how restlessly we pace the aisles, cursing the mmutes for loiteringwaiting, waiting, waiting for the stationwhen we reach the station, that will be it we cry when im when i buy a new sl mercedes benz when i put the last kid though college when i have paid off the mortgage when i get a promblewhen i reach the age of retirement, i shall live happily ever after sooner or later, we must realize there is no station, no one place to arrive at once and for all the true joy of life is the trip the station is only a dream it constantly outdistances us relish the moment is a good motto, especially when coupled with psalm  this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it, it isnt the burdens of today that drive men mad it is the regrets over yesterday and the fear oftomorrow regret and fear are twin thieves who rob us of todayso stop pacing the aisles and counting the milesinstead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot more often, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less life must be lived as we go along the station will come soon enoughchinese ,  sl  noenglishhappiness is like a stone dropped into a pool to set in motion an every widening, circle of ripples as stevenson has said, being happy is a dutythere is no exact definition of the word happiness happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons the key is not wealth or physical wellbeing, since we find beggars, patients and socalled failures who are extremely happybeing happy is a sort of unexpected dividend but staying happy is an accomplishment, a triumph of soul and character it is not selfish to struggle for it it is indeed, a duty to ourselves and othersbeing unhappy is like an infectious disease it causes people to shrink away from the sufferer he soon frnds himself alone, miserable and embitteredthere is, however, a cure so simple as to seem, at first glance, ridiculous if you dont feel happy, pretend to beit works before long you will that instead of repelling people, you attract them, you discover how deeply rewarding it is to be the center of wider and wider circles of good willthen the makebelieve becomes a realityr you possess the secret of peace of mind and can forget yourself in being of service to others,being happy once it is realized as a duty and established as a habit opens doors into unimaginable gardens thronged with grateful friendschinesenoenglishno young man believes he shall ever die it was a saying of my brothers, and a fine one there is a feeling of eternity in youth, which makes us amend for everything to be young is to be as one of the immortal gods one half of time indeed is flown, the other half remains in store for us with all its countless treasures, and we see no limit to our hopes and wishes we make the coming age our ownthe vast, the unbounded prospect lies before us death, old age are words without a meaning that pass by us like the idea air which we regard not others may have undergone, or may still be liable to themwe bear a charmed life, which laughs to scom all such sickly fancies as in setting out on delightful journeywe strain our eager gaze forward bidding the lovely scenes at distance hail and see no end to the landscape, new objects presenting themselves as we advance, so, in the commencement of life, we set no bounds to our inclinations, nor to the unrestricted opportunities of gratifying them we have as yet found no obstacle, no disposition to flag and it seems that we can go on so forever we look round in a new world, full of life, and motion, and ceaseless progress and feel in ourselves au the vigor and spirit to keep pace with it, and do not foresee from any present symptoms how we shall be left behind in the natural course of things, decline into old age, and drop into the graveit is the simplicity, and as it were abstractedness of our feelings in youth, that so to speak identifies us with nature, and our experience being slight and our passions strong deludes us into a belief of being immortal like it our shortlives connection with existence we fondly flatter ourselves, is an indissoluble and lasting uniona honeymoon that knows neither coldness, jar, nor separation as infants smile and sleep, we are rocked in the cradle of our wayward fancies, and lulled into security by the roar ofthe ruuverse around uswe quaff the cup oflife with eager haste without draining it, instead ofwhich it only overflows, the more objects press around us, filling the mind with their magnitude and with the strong of desires that wait upon them, so that we have no room for the thoughts of deathchinese noenglishto a large degree, the measure of our peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present momentlrrespective of what happened yesterday or last year, and what may or may not happen tomorrow, the present moment is where you are alwayswithout question, many of us have mastered the neurotic art of spending much of our lives worrying about a variety of things all at oncewe allow past problems and future concems to dominate our present moments, so much so that we end up anxious, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless on the flip side, we also postpone our gratification, our stated priorities, and our happiness, often convincing ourselves thatsomedaywill be better than today, unfortunately, the same mental dynamics that tell us to look toward the future will only repeat themselves so thatsomeday never actually arrives john lennon once said life is whats happening while were busy making other plans when were busy makingother plans, our children are busy growing up, the people we love are moving away and dying, our bodies are getting out of shape, and our dreams are slipping away inshort, we miss out our lifemany people live as if life were a dress rehearsal for some later date it isnt in fact, no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow now is the only time we have, and the only time that we have any control over when our attention is in the present moment, we push fear from our minds fear is the concem over events that might happen in the future we won t have enough money, our children will get into trouble, we will get old and die, whateverto combat fear, the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present mark twain said, i have been through some terrible tlungs in my life, some of which actually happened i dont think i can say it any better, practice keeping your attention on the here and now your effortswill pay great dividendschinese noenglishtoday i begin a new lifetoday i shed my old skin which has, too long, suffered the bruises of failure and the wounds ofmediority,today i am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for alltoday i will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generationtoday i will savor the taste of grapes frornthese vines and verily i will swallow the seed ofsuccess buried in each and new life will sprout within methe career i have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heart break and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earthyet i will not fail, as the others, for in my hands i now hold the charts which will guide through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dreamfailure no longer will be my payment for struggle just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure failure, like pain, is alien to my life in the past i accqpted it as i accepted pain now i reject it and i am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams time teaches au things to him who lives forever but i have not the luxury of etemity yet within my allotted time i must prachce the art of patience for nature acts never in haste to create the olive, king ofall trees, a hundred years is required an onion plant is old in nine weeks i have lived as an onion plant it has not pleased me, now i would become the geatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmanand how will this be accomplished for i have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve the greatness and already i have stumbled ignorance and fallen into pools of selfpity the answer is simple i will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidlyin truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course ofinstruction devours mens years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessarr to acquire her special wisdom the end finds it wasted on dead men furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrowonly principles endure and these i now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatnesss are contained in the words of these scrous what they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words yet failure is always described but oneway failure is mans inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may bein truth,the difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits good habits are the key to all success bad habits are the unlocked door to failure thus, the fust law i will obey, which precedeth au others isl will form good habits and become their slaveas a child i was slave to my impulses now i am slave to my habits,as are all grown men i have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already markedout a path which threatens to imprison my future  my actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst ofthese tyrants is habit therefore, ifl must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits my bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seedi will form good habits and become their slaveand how will iaccomplish this difficult feat through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success for it is another ofnatures laws that only a habit can subdue another habit so, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, i must discipline myselfwith the first ofmy new habits which is as followsi will read each scroll for tlurty days in this prescribed manner, before i proceed to the next scroll first, i will read the words in silence when i arise then, i will read the words in silence after i have partaken of my midday meal last, i will read the words again just before i retire at days end, and most important, on this occasion i will read the words aloudon the next day i will repeat this procedure, and i will continue in that manner for thirty days then, i will tum to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days, i will continue in this manner until i have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habitand what will be accomplished with this habit herein lies the hidden secret of all mans accomplishmentsas i repeat the wordsdaily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways i do not comprehendas the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind i will begin to awake, each moming, with a vitality i have never known before my vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear i once knew at sunrise, and i will be happier than i ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorroweventually i will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as i was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soonthese actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easythus a new and good habit is bom, for when an act becomes easy throug,h constant repetiton it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is mans nature to perform it often when i perform it often it becomes a habit and i become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my willtoday i begin a new lifeand i make a solemn oath to myselfthat nothing will retard my new lifes growth i will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can i substitute another for it i must not , i will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mineas i read and reread the words in the scrolls to follow, never will i allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity ofits words to cause me to treat the scrolls message lightly th ousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grape skin and pulp are tossed to the birds so it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages much has been filtered and tossed to the wind only the pure truth lies disfilled in the words to come i will drink as instructed and spill not a drop and the seed of success i will swallowtoday my old slan has become as dust i will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today i am a new man, with a new lifechinese o noenglishthe life i desiredthat must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely graceit reminds you ofa placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vast sea, but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indiflerent, that you aretroubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that i felt in such an existence, the share ofthe great majority , something anussi recognized its social value i saw its ordered

for knowledge, and unbearablepity for the suffering of mankind these passions, like great winds, haveblown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean ofanguish, reaching to the verge of despairi have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy  ecstasy so great that i would have sacrificed all the rest oflife for a few hours of this joy i have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness  that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the run of the world into cold unfathomable lifeless abyss i have sought it, finally, because in the union oflove i have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined this is what i sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is whatat lastl have found,with equal passion i have sought knowledge i have wished to understand the hearts of men, i have wished to know why the stars shine and i have tried to apprehend the

afraid to start a business, borrow a bunch of money, or quit a wellpaying job to travel the worldat the same time, the fact that i took chances and often failed gave me the wisdom that i have today lessons leamed througb failure tend to be much more meaningful than lessons leamed otherwisenow that im in my s, life is pretty good, while i havent learned it all, i feel my head is screwed on straight enough that life is much less stressful  ive come into my own and built the foundation for a secure and prosperous futureeven though things are going well, i often imagine what it would be like to go back into the past and teach myself what i know now i know enough to be certain that i lost most of my twenties to a struggle with debt and poor decisions if i had done things differently, maybe i could have been where i am now at age ,could you imagine self employed and almost finacianciall independent at age  no not almost my expenses were much less back then i would have been financially freefi know, it doesnt do any good to ask what if if i had known it all at age  i probably would have been a little cocky doing things the hard way seasoned my character i like who i am and i wouldnt change a thingbut what ifwhat id tell myself at sometimes i imagine that im in a fishing boat, thousands of miles away from the life i know, slowly drifting across a lake as i recline at
